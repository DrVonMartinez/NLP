THE TRAGEDY OF KING RICHARD II

Old John of Gaunt  timehonourd Lancaster 
Hast thou  according to thy oath and band 
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son 
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal 
Which then our leisure would not let us hear 
Against the Duke of Norfolk  Thomas Mowbray 

I have  my liege 

Tell me  moreover  hast thou sounded him 
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice 
Or worthily  as a good subject should 
On some known ground of treachery in him 

As near as I could sift him on that argument 
On some apparent danger seen in him 
Aimd at your highness  no inveterate malice 

Then call them to our presence  face to face 
And frowning brow to brow  ourselves will hear 
The accuser and the accused freely speak 

Highstomachd are they both  and full of ire 
In rage deaf as the sea  hasty as fire 


Many years of happy days befall 
My gracious sovereign  my most loving liege 

Each day still better others happiness 
Until the heavens  envying earths good hap 
Add an immortal title to your crown 

We thank you both  yet one but flatters us 
As well appeareth by the cause you come 
Namely  to appeal each other of high treason 
Cousin of Hereford  what dost thou object 
Against the Duke of Norfolk  Thomas Mowbray 

First heaven be the record to my speech 
In the devotion of a subjects love 
Tendering the precious safety of my prince 
And free from other misbegotten hate 
Come I appellant to this princely presence 
Now  Thomas Mowbray  do I turn to thee 
And mark my greeting well  for what I speak 
My body shall make good upon this earth 
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven 
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant 
Too good to be so and too bad to live 
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky 
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly 
Once more  the more to aggravate the note 
With a foul traitors name stuff I thy throat 
And wish  so please my sovereign  ere I move 
What my tongue speaks  my right drawn sword may prove 

Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal 
Tis not the trial of a womans war 
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues 
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain 
The blood is hot that must be coold for this 
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast 
As to be hushd and nought at all to say 
First  the fair reverence of your highness curbs me 
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech 
Which else would post until it had returnd 
These terms of treason doubled down his throat 
Setting aside his high bloods royalty 
And let him be no kinsman to my liege 
I do defy him  and I spit at him 
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain 
Which to maintain I would allow him odds 
And meet him  were I tied to run afoot 
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps 
Or any other ground inhabitable 
Wherever Englishman durst set his foot 
Meantime let this defend my loyalty 
By all my hopes  most falsely doth he lie 

Pale trembling coward  there I throw my gage 
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king 
And lay aside my high bloods royalty 
Which fear  not reverence  makes thee to except 
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength 
As to take up mine honours pawn  then stoop 
By that  and all the rites of knighthood else 
Will I make good against thee  arm to arm 
What I have spoke  or thou canst worse devise 

I take it up  and by that sword I swear 
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder 
Ill answer thee in any fair degree 
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial 
And when I mount  alive may I not light 
If I be traitor or unjustly fight 

What doth our cousin lay to Mowbrays charge 
It must be great that can inherit us 
So much as of a thought of ill in him 

Look  what I speak  my life shall prove it true 
That Mowbray hath receivd eight thousand nobles 
In name of lendings for your highness soldiers 
The which he hath detaind for lewd employments 
Like a false traitor and injurious villain 
Besides I say and will in battle prove 
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge 
That ever was surveyd by English eye 
That all the treasons for these eighteen years 
Complotted and contrived in this land 
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring 
Further I say and further will maintain 
Upon his bad life to make all this good 
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucesters death 
Suggest his soon believing adversaries 
And consequently  like a traitor coward 
Sluicd out his innocent soul through streams of blood 
Which blood  like sacrificing Abels  cries 
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth 
To me for justice and rough chastisement 
And  by the glorious worth of my descent 
This arm shall do it  or this life be spent 

How high a pitch his resolution soars 
Thomas of Norfolk  what sayst thou to this 

O  let my sovereign turn away his face 
And bid his ears a little while be deaf 
Till I have told this slander of his blood 
How God and good men hate so foul a liar 

Mowbray  impartial are our eyes and ears 
Were he my brother  nay  my kingdoms heir 
As he is but my fathers brothers son 
Now  by my sceptres awe I make a vow 
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood 
Should nothing privilege him  nor partialize 
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul 
He is our subject  Mowbray  so art thou 
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow 

Then  Bolingbroke  as low as to thy heart 
Through the false passage of thy throat  thou liest 
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais 
Disbursd I duly to his highness soldiers 
The other part reservd I by consent 
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt 
Upon remainder of a dear account 
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen 
Now swallow down that lie  For Gloucesters death 
I slew him not  but to mine own disgrace 
Neglected my sworn duty in that case 
For you  my noble Lord of Lancaster 
The honourable father to my foe 
Once did I lay an ambush for your life 
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul 
But ere I last receivd the sacrament 
I did confess it  and exactly beggd 
Your Graces pardon  and I hope I had it 
This is my fault  as for the rest appeald 
It issues from the rancour of a villain 
A recreant and most degenerate traitor 
Which in myself I boldly will defend 
And interchangeably hurl down my gage 
Upon this overweening traitors foot 
To prove myself a loyal gentleman 
Even in the best blood chamberd in his bosom 
In haste whereof  most heartily I pray 
Your highness to assign our trial day 

Wrathkindled gentlemen  be ruld by me 
Lets purge this choler without letting blood 
This we prescribe  though no physician 
Deep malice makes too deep incision 
Forget  forgive  conclude and be agreed 
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed 
Good uncle  let this end where it begun 
Well calm the Duke of Norfolk  you your son 

To be a makepeace shall become my age 
Throw down  my son  the Duke of Norfolks gage 

And  Norfolk  throw down his 

When  Harry  when 
Obedience bids I should not bid again 

Norfolk  throw down  we bid  there is no boot 

Myself I throw  dread sovereign  at thy foot 
My life thou shalt command  but not my shame 
The one my duty owes  but my fair name 
Despite of death that lives upon my grave 
To dark dishonours use thou shalt not have 
I am disgracd  impeachd  and baffled here 
Piercd to the soul with slanders venomd spear 
The which no balm can cure but his heartblood 
Which breathd this poison 

Rage must be withstood 
Give me his gage  lions make leopards tame 

Yea  but not change his spots  take but my shame 
And I resign my gage  My dear dear lord 
The purest treasure mortal times afford 
Is spotless reputation  that away 
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay 
A jewel in a tentimesbarrdup chest 
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast 
Mine honour is my life  both grow in one 
Take honour from me  and my life is done 
Then  dear my liege  mine honour let me try 
In that I live and for that will I die 

Cousin  throw down your gage  do you begin 

O  God defend my soul from such deep sin 
Shall I seem crest falln in my fathers sight 
Or with pale beggarfear impeach my height 
Before this outdard dastard  Ere my tongue 
Shall wound mine honour with such feeble wrong 
Or sound so base a parle  my teeth shall tear 
The slavish motive of recanting fear 
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace 
Where shame doth harbour  even in Mowbrays face 


We were not born to sue  but to command 
Which since we cannot do to make you friends 
Be ready  as your lives shall answer it 
At Coventry  upon Saint Lamberts day 
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate 
The swelling difference of your settled hate 
Since we cannot atone you  we shall see 
Justice design the victors chivalry 
Marshal  command our officersatarms 
Be ready to direct these home alarms 


Alas  the part I had in Woodstocks blood 
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims 
To stir against the butchers of his life 
But since correction lieth in those hands 
Which made the fault that we cannot correct 
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven 
Who  when they see the hours ripe on earth 
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads 

Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur 
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire 
Edwards seven sons  whereof thyself art one 
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood 
Or seven fair branches springing from one root 
Some of those seven are dried by natures course 
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut 
But Thomas  my dear lord  my life  my Gloucester 
One vial full of Edwards sacred blood 
One flourishing branch of his most royal root 
Is crackd  and all the precious liquor spilt 
Is hackd down  and his summer leaves all vaded 
By envys hand and murders bloody axe 
Ah  Gaunt  his blood was thine  that bed  that womb 
That metal  that selfmould  that fashiond thee 
Made him a man  and though thou livst and breathst 
Yet art thou slain in him  thou dost consent 
In some large measure to thy fathers death 
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die 
Who was the model of thy fathers life 
Call it not patience  Gaunt  it is despair 
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughterd 
Thou showst the naked pathway to thy life 
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee 
That which in mean men we entitle patience 
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts 
What shall I say  to safeguard thine own life 
The best way is to venge my Gloucesters death 

Gods is the quarrel  for Gods substitute 
His deputy anointed in his sight 
Hath causd his death  the which if wrongfully 
Let heaven revenge  for I may never lift 
An angry arm against his minister 

Where then  alas  may I complain myself 

To God  the widows champion and defence 

Why then  I will  Farewell  old Gaunt 
Thou gost to Coventry  there to behold 
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight 
O  sit my husbands wrongs on Herefords spear 
That it may enter butcher Mowbrays breast 
Or if misfortune miss the first career 
Be Mowbrays sins so heavy in his bosom 
That they may break his foaming coursers back 
And throw the rider headlong in the lists 
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford 
Farewell  old Gaunt  thy sometimes brothers wife 
With her companion grief must end her life 

Sister  farewell  I must to Coventry 
As much good stay with thee as go with me 

Yet one word more  Grief boundeth where it falls 
Not with the empty hollowness  but weight 
I take my leave before I have begun 
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done 
Commend me to my brother  Edmund York 
Lo  this is all  nay  yet depart not so 
Though this be all  do not so quickly go 
I shall remember more  Bid him ah  what 
With all good speed at Plashy visit me 
Alack  and what shall good old York there see 
But empty lodgings and unfurnishd walls 
Unpeopled offices  untrodden stones 
And what hear there for welcome but my groans 
Therefore commend me  let him not come there 
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where 
Desolate  desolate will I hence  and die 
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye 


My Lord Aumerle  is Harry Hereford armd 

Yea  at all points  and longs to enter in 

The Duke of Norfolk  sprightfully and bold 
Stays but the summons of the appellants trumpet 

Why then  the champions are prepard  and stay 
For nothing but his majestys approach 


Marshal  demand of yonder champion 
The cause of his arrival here in arms 
Ask him his name  and orderly proceed 
To swear him in the justice of his cause 

In Gods name  and the kings  say who thou art 
And why thou comst thus knightly clad in arms 
Against what man thou comst  and what thy quarrel 
Speak truly  on thy knighthood and thine oath 
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour 

My name is Thomas Mowbray  Duke of Norfolk 
Who hither come engaged by my oath 
Which God defend a knight should violate 
Both to defend my loyalty and truth 
To God  my king  and his succeeding issue 
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me 
And  by the grace of God and this mine arm 
To prove him  in defending of myself 
A traitor to my God  my king  and me 
And as I truly fight  defend me heaven 

Marshal  ask yonder knight in arms 
Both who he is and why he cometh hither 
Thus plated in habiliments of war 
And formally  according to our law 
Depose him in the justice of his cause 

What is thy name  and wherefore comst thou hither 
Before King Richard in his royal lists 
Against whom comest thou  and whats thy quarrel 
Speak like a true knight  so defend thee heaven 

Harry of Hereford  Lancaster  and Derby 
Am I  who ready here do stand in arms 
To prove by Gods grace and my bodys valour 
In lists  on Thomas Mowbray  Duke of Norfolk 
That hes a traitor foul and dangerous 
To God of heaven  King Richard  and to me 
And as I truly fight  defend me heaven 

On pain of death  no person be so bold 
Or daringhardy as to touch the lists 
Except the marshal and such officers 
Appointed to direct these fair designs 

Lord marshal  let me kiss my sovereigns hand 
And bow my knee before his majesty 
For Mowbray and myself are like two men 
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage 
Then let us take a ceremonious leave 
And loving farewell of our several friends 

The appellant in all duty greets your highness 
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave 

We will descend and fold him in our arms 
Cousin of Hereford  as thy cause is right 
So be thy fortune in this royal fight 
Farewell  my blood  which if today thou shed 
Lament we may  but not revenge thee dead 

O  let no noble eye profane a tear 
For me  if I be gord with Mowbrays spear 
As confident as is the falcons flight 
Against a bird  do I with Mowbray fight 
My loving lord  I take my leave of you 
Of you  my noble cousin  Lord Aumerle 
Not sick  although I have to do with death 
But lusty  young  and cheerly drawing breath 
Lo  as at English feasts  so I regreet 
The daintiest last  to make the end most sweet 
O thou  the earthly author of my blood 
Whose youthful spirit  in me regenerate 
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up 
To reach at victory above my head 
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers 
And with thy blessings steel my lances point 
That it may enter Mowbrays waxen coat 
And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt 
Even in the lusty haviour of his son 

God in thy good cause make thee prosperous 
Be swift like lightning in the execution 
And let thy blows  doubly redoubled 
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque 
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy 
Rouse up thy youthful blood  be valiant and live 

Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive 


However God or fortune cast my lot 
There lives or dies  true to King Richards throne 
A loyal  just  and upright gentleman 
Never did captive with a freer heart 
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace 
His golden uncontrolld enfranchisement 
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate 
This feast of battle with mine adversary 
Most mighty liege  and my companion peers 
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years 
As gentle and as jocund as to jest 
Go I to fight  truth has a quiet breast 

Farewell  my lord  securely I espy 
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye 
Order the trial  marshal  and begin 


Harry of Hereford  Lancaster  and Derby 
Receive thy lance  and God defend the right 

Strong as a tower in hope  I cry amen  

Go bear this lance to Thomas  Duke of Norfolk 

Harry of Hereford  Lancaster  and Derby 
Stands here for God  his sovereign  and himself 
On pain to be found false and recreant 
To prove the Duke of Norfolk  Thomas Mowbray 
A traitor to his God  his king  and him 
And dares him to set forward to the fight 

Here standeth Thomas Mowbray  Duke of Norfolk 
On pain to be found false and recreant 
Both to defend himself and to approve 
Henry of Hereford  Lancaster  and Derby 
To God  his sovereign  and to him  disloyal 
Courageously and with a free desire 
Attending but the signal to begin 

Sound  trumpets  and set forward  combatants 

Stay  stay  the king hath thrown his warderdown 

Let them lay by their helmets and their spears 
And both return back to their chairs again 
Withdraw with us  and let the trumpets sound 
While we return these dukes what we decree 

Draw near 
And list what with our council we have done 
For that our kingdoms earth should not be soild 
With that dear blood which it hath fostered 
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect 
Of civil wounds ploughd up with neighbours swords 
And for we think the eaglewinged pride 
Of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts 
With rivalhating envy  set on you 
To wake our peace  which in our countrys cradle 
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep 
Which so rousd up with boistrous untund drums 
With harshresounding trumpets dreadful bray 
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms 
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace 
And make us wade even in our kindreds blood 
Therefore  we banish you our territories 
You  cousin Hereford  upon pain of life 
Till twice five summers have enrichd our fields 
Shall not regreet our fair dominions 
But tread the stranger paths of banishment 

Your will be done  this must my comfort be 
That sun that warms you here shall shine on me 
And those his golden beams to you here lent 
Shall point on me and gild my banishment 

Norfolk  for thee remains a heavier doom 
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce 
The sly slow hours shall not determinate 
The dateless limit of thy dear exile 
The hopeless word of never to return 
Breathe I against thee  upon pain of life 

A heavy sentence  my most sovereign liege 
And all unlookd for from your highness mouth 
A dearer merit  not so deep a maim 
As to be cast forth in the common air 
Have I deserved at your highness hands 
The language I have learnd these forty years 
My native English  now I must forego 
And now my tongues use is to me no more 
Than an unstringed viol or a harp 
Or like a cunning instrument casd up 
Or  being open  put into his hands 
That knows no touch to tune the harmony 
Within my mouth you have engaold my tongue 
Doubly portcullisd with my teeth and lips 
And dull  unfeeling  barren ignorance 
Is made my gaoler to attend on me 
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse 
Too far in years to be a pupil now 
What is thy sentence then but speechless death 
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath 

It boots thee not to be compassionate 
After our sentence plaining comes too late 

Then  thus I turn me from my countrys light 
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night 


Return again  and take an oath with thee 
Lay on our royal sword your banishd hands 
Swear by the duty that you owe to God 
Our part therein we banish with yourselves 
To keep the oath that we administer 
You never shall so help you truth and God 
Embrace each others love in banishment 
Nor never look upon each others face 
Nor never write  regreet  nor reconcile 
This lowring tempest of your homebred hate 
Nor never by advised purpose meet 
To plot  contrive  or complot any ill 
Gainst us  our state  our subjects  or our land 

I swear 

And I  to keep all this 

Norfolk  so far  as to mine enemy 
By this time  had the king permitted us 
One of our souls had wanderd in the air 
Banishd this frail sepulchre of our flesh 
As now our flesh is banishd from this land 
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm 
Since thou hast far to go  bear not along 
The clogging burden of a guilty soul 

No  Bolingbroke  if ever I were traitor 
My name be blotted from the book of life 
And I from heaven banishd as from hence 
But what thou art  God  thou  and I do know 
And all too soon  I fear  the king shall rue 
Farewell  my liege  Now no way can I stray 
Save back to England  all the worlds my way 


Uncle  even in the glasses of thine eyes 
I see thy grieved heart  thy sad aspect 
Hath from the number of his banishd years 
Pluckd four away 

Six frozen winters spent 
Return with welcome home from banishment 

How long a time lies in one little word 
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs 
End in a word  such is the breath of kings 

I thank my liege  that in regard of me 
He shortens four years of my sons exile 
But little vantage shall I reap thereby 
For  ere the six years that he hath to spend 
Can change their moons and bring their times about 
My oildried lamp and timebewasted light 
Shall be extinct with age and endless night 
My inch of taper will be burnt and done 
And blindfold death not let me see my son 

Why  uncle  thou hast many years to live 

But not a minute  king  that thou canst give 
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow 
And pluck nights from me  but not lend a morrow 
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age 
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage 
Thy word is current with him for my death 
But dead  thy kingdom cannot buy my breath 

Thy son is banishd upon good advice 
Whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave 
Why at our justice seemst thou then to lower 

Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour 
You urgd me as a judge  but I had rather 
You would have bid me argue like a father 
O  had it been a stranger  not my child 
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild 
A partial slander sought I to avoid 
And in the sentence my own life destroyd 
Alas  I lookd when some of you should say 
I was too strict to make mine own away 
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue 
Against my will to do myself this wrong 

Cousin  farewell  and  uncle  bid him so 
Six years we banish him  and he shall go 


Cousin  farewell  what presence must not know 
From where you do remain let paper show 

My lord  no leave take I  for I will ride 
As far as land will let me  by your side 

O  to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words 
That thou returnst no greeting to thy friends 

I have too few to take my leave of you 
When the tongues office should be prodigal 
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart 

Thy grief is but thy absence for a time 

Joy absent  grief is present for that time 

What is six winters  they are quickly gone 

To men in joy  but grief makes one hour ten 

Call it a travel that thou takst for pleasure 

My heart will sigh when I miscall it so 
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage 

The sullen passage of thy weary steps 
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set 
The precious jewel of thy home return 

Nay  rather  every tedious stride I make 
Will but remember me what a deal of world 
I wander from the jewels that I love 
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood 
To foreign passages  and in the end 
Having my freedom  boast of nothing else 
But that I was a journeyman to grief 

All places that the eye of heaven visits 
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens 
Teach thy necessity to reason thus 
There is no virtue like necessity 
Think not the king did banish thee 
But thou the king  Woe doth the heavier sit 
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne 
Go  say I sent thee forth to purchase honour 
And not the king exild thee  or suppose 
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air 
And thou art flying to a fresher clime 
Look  what thy soul holds dear  imagine it 
To lie that way thou gost  not whence thou comst 
Suppose the singing birds musicians 
The grass whereon thou treadst the presence strewd 
The flowers fair ladies  and thy steps no more 
Than a delightful measure or a dance 
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite 
The man that mocks at it and sets it light 

O  who can hold a fire in his hand 
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus 
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite 
By bare imagination of a feast 
Or wallow naked in December snow 
By thinking on fantastic summers heat 
O  no  the apprehension of the good 
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse 
Fell sorrows tooth doth never rankle more 
Than when it bites  but lanceth not the sore 

Come  come  my son  Ill bring thee on thy way 
Had I thy youth and cause  I would not stay 

Then  Englands ground  farewell  sweet soil  adieu 
My mother  and my nurse  that bears me yet 
Whereer I wander  boast of this I can 
Though banishd  yet a trueborn Englishman 


We did observe  Cousin Aumerle 
How far brought you high Hereford on his way 

I brought high Hereford  if you call him so 
But to the next highway  and there I left him 

And say  what store of parting tears were shed 

Faith  none for me  except the northeast wind 
Which then blew bitterly against our faces 
Awakd the sleeping rheum  and so by chance 
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear 

What said our cousin when you parted with him 

Farewell  
And  for my heart disdained that my tongue 
Should so profane the word  that taught me craft 
To counterfeit oppression of such grief 
That words seemd buried in my sorrows grave 
Marry  would the word farewell have lengthend hours 
And added years to his short banishment 
He should have had a volume of farewells 
But  since it would not  he had none of me 

He is our cousin  cousin  but tis doubt 
When time shall call him home from banishment 
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends 
Ourself and Bushy  Bagot here and Green 
Observd his courtship to the common people 
How he did seem to dive into their hearts 
With humble and familiar courtesy 
What reverence he did throw away on slaves 
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles 
And patient underbearing of his fortune 
As twere to banish their affects with him 
Off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench 
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well 
And had the tribute of his supple knee 
With Thanks  my countrymen  my loving friends  
As were our England in reversion his 
And he our subjects next degree in hope 

Well  he is gone  and with him go these thoughts 
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland 
Expedient manage must be made  my liege 
Ere further leisure yield them further means 
For their advantage and your highness loss 

We will ourself in person to this war 
And  for our coffers with too great a court 
And liberal largess are grown somewhat light 
We are enforcd to farm our royal realm 
The revenue whereof shall furnish us 
For our affairs in hand  If that come short 
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters 
Whereto  when they shall know what men are rich 
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold 
And send them after to supply our wants 
For we will make for Ireland presently 

Bushy  what news 

Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick  my lord 
Suddenly taken  and hath sent posthaste 
To entreat your majesty to visit him 

Where lies he 

At Ely House 

Now  put it  God  in his physicians mind 
To help him to his grave immediately 
The lining of his coffers shall make coats 
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars 
Come  gentlemen  lets all go visit him 
Pray God we may make haste  and come too late 

Amen 

Will the king come  that I may breathe my last 
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth 

Vex not yourself  nor strive not with your breath 
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear 

O  but they say the tongues of dying men 
Enforce attention like deep harmony 
Where words are scarce  they are seldom spent in vain 
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain 
He that no more must say is listend more 
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose 
More are mens ends markd than their lives before 
The setting sun  and music at the close 
As the last taste of sweets  is sweetest last 
Writ in remembrance more than things long past 
Though Richard my lifes counsel would not hear 
My deaths sad tale may yet undeaf his ear 

No  it is stoppd with other flattering sounds 
As praises of his state  then there are fond 
Lascivious metres  to whose venom sound 
The open ear of youth doth always listen 
Report of fashions in proud Italy 
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation 
Limps after in base imitation 
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity 
So it be new theres no respect how vile 
That is not quickly buzzd into his ears 
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard 
Where will doth mutiny with wits regard 
Direct not him whose way himself will choose 
Tis breath thou lackst  and that breath wilt thou lose 

Methinks I am a prophet new inspird 
And thus expiring do foretell of him 
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last 
For violent fires soon burn out themselves 
Small showers last long  but sudden storms are short 
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes 
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder 
Light vanity  insatiate cormorant 
Consuming means  soon preys upon itself 
This royal throne of kings  this scepterd isle 
This earth of majesty  this seat of Mars 
This other Eden  demiparadise 
This fortress built by Nature for herself 
Against infection and the hand of war 
This happy breed of men  this little world 
This precious stone set in the silver sea 
Which serves it in the office of a wall 
Or as a moat defensive to a house 
Against the envy of less happier lands 
This blessed plot  this earth  this realm  this England 
This nurse  this teeming womb of royal kings 
Feard by their breed and famous by their birth 
Renowned for their deeds as far from home 
For Christian service and true chivalry 
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry 
Of the worlds ransom  blessed Marys Son 
This land of such dear souls  this dear  dear land 
Dear for her reputation through the world 
Is now leasd out I die pronouncing it 
Like to a tenement  or pelting farm 
England  bound in with the triumphant sea 
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege 
Of watery Neptune  is now bound in with shame 
With inky blots  and rotten parchment bonds 
That England  that was wont to conquer others 
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself 
Ah  would the scandal vanish with my life 
How happy then were my ensuing death 


The king is come  deal mildly with his youth 
For young hot colts  being ragd  do rage the more 

How fares our noble uncle  Lancaster 

What comfort  man  How ist with aged Gaunt 

O  how that name befits my composition 
Old Gaunt indeed  and gaunt in being old 
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast 
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt 
For sleeping England long time have I watchd 
Watching breeds leanness  leanness is all gaunt 
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon 
Is my strict fast  I mean my childrens looks 
And therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt 
Gaunt am I for the grave  gaunt as a grave 
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones 

Can sick men play so nicely with their names 

No  misery makes sport to mock itself 
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me 
I mock my name  great king  to flatter thee 

Should dying men flatter with those that live 

No  no  men living flatter those that die 

Thou  now adying  sayst thou flatterst me 

O  no  thou diest  though I the sicker be 

I am in health  I breathe  and see thee ill 

Now  he that made me knows I see thee ill 
Ill in myself to see  and in thee seeing ill 
Thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land 
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick 
And thou  too careless patient as thou art 
Committst thy anointed body to the cure 
Of those physicians that first wounded thee 
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown 
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head 
And yet  incaged in so small a verge 
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land 
O  had thy grandsire  with a prophets eye 
Seen how his sons son should destroy his sons 
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame 
Deposing thee before thou wert possessd 
Which art possessd now to depose thyself 
Why  cousin  wert thou regent of the world 
It were a shame to let this land by lease 
But for thy world enjoying but this land 
Is it not more than shame to shame it so 
Landlord of England art thou now  not king 
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law 
And 

And thou a lunatic leanwitted fool 
Presuming on an agues privilege 
Darst with thy frozen admonition 
Make pale our cheek  chasing the royal blood 
With fury from his native residence 
Now  by my seats right royal majesty 
Wert thou not brother to great Edwards son 
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head 
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders 

O  spare me not  my brother Edwards son 
For that I was his father Edwards son 
That blood already  like the pelican 
Hast thou tappd out and drunkenly carousd 
My brother Gloucester  plain wellmeaning soul 
Whom fair befall in heaven mongst happy souls 
May be a precedent and witness good 
That thou respectst not spilling Edwards blood 
Join with the present sickness that I have 
And thy unkindness be like crooked age 
To crop at once a toolong witherd flower 
Live in thy shame  but die not shame with thee 
These words hereafter thy tormentors be 
Convey me to my bed  then to my grave 
Love they to live that love and honour have 


And let them die that age and sullens have 
For both hast thou  and both become the grave 

I do beseech your majesty  impute his words 
To wayward sickliness and age in him 
He loves you  on my life  and holds you dear 
As Harry  Duke of Hereford  were he here 

Right  you say true  as Herefords love  so his 
As theirs  so mine  and all be as it is 


My liege  old Gaunt commends him to your majesty 

What says he 

Nay  nothing  all is said 
His tongue is now a stringless instrument 
Words  life  and all  old Lancaster hath spent 

Be York the next that must be bankrupt so 
Though death be poor  it ends a mortal woe 

The ripest fruit first falls  and so doth he 
His time is spent  our pilgrimage must be 
So much for that  Now for our Irish wars 
We must supplant those rough rugheaded kerns 
Which live like venom where no venom else 
But only they have privilege to live 
And for these great affairs do ask some charge 
Towards our assistance we do seize to us 
The plate  coin  revenues  and moveables 
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possessd 

How long shall I be patient  Ah  how long 
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong 
Not Gloucesters death  nor Herefords banishment 
Not Gaunts rebukes  nor Englands private wrongs 
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke 
About his marriage  nor my own disgrace 
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek 
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereigns face 
I am the last of noble Edwards sons 
Of whom thy father  Prince of Wales  was first 
In war was never lion ragd more fierce 
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild 
Than was that young and princely gentleman 
His face thou hast  for even so lookd he 
Accomplishd with the number of thy hours 
But when he frownd  it was against the French 
And not against his friends  his noble hand 
Did win what he did spend  and spent not that 
Which his triumphant fathers hand had won 
His hands were guilty of no kindreds blood 
But bloody with the enemies of his kin 
O  Richard  York is too far gone with grief 
Or else he never would compare between 

Why  uncle  whats the matter 

O  my liege 
Pardon me  if you please  if not  I  pleasd 
Not to be pardond  am content withal 
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands 
The royalties and rights of banishd Hereford 
Is not Gaunt dead  and doth not Hereford live 
Was not Gaunt just  and is not Harry true 
Did not the one deserve to have an heir 
Is not his heir a welldeserving son 
Take Herefords rights away  and take from Time 
His charters and his customary rights 
Let not tomorrow then ensue today 
Be not thyself  for how art thou a king 
But by fair sequence and succession 
Now  afore God God forbid I say true 
If you do wrongfully seize Herefords rights 
Call in the letterspatent that he hath 
By his attorneysgeneral to sue 
His livery  and deny his offerd homage 
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head 
You lose a thousand welldisposed hearts 
And prick my tender patience to those thoughts 
Which honour and allegiance cannot think 

Think what you will  we seize into our hands 
His plate  his goods  his money  and his lands 

Ill not be by the while  my liege  farewell 
What will ensue hereof  theres none can tell 
But by bad courses may be understood 
That their events can never fall out good 


Go  Bushy  to the Earl of Wiltshire straight 
Bid him repair to us to Ely House 
To see this business  Tomorrow next 
We will for Ireland  and tis time  I trow 
And we create  in absence of ourself 
Our uncle York lord governor of England 
For he is just  and always lovd us well 
Come on  our queen  tomorrow must we part 
Be merry  for our time of stay is short 

Well  lords  the Duke of Lancaster is dead 

And living too  for now his son is duke 

Barely in title  not in revenue 

Richly in both  if justice had her right 

My heart is great  but it must break with silence 
Eret be disburdend with a liberal tongue 

Nay  speak thy mind  and let him neer speak more 
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm 

Tends that thoudst speak to the Duke of Hereford 
If it be so  out with it boldly  man 
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him 

No good at all that I can do for him 
Unless you call it good to pity him 
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony 

Now  afore God  tis shame such wrongs are borne 
In him  a royal prince  and many more 
Of noble blood in this declining land 
The king is not himself  but basely led 
By flatterers  and what they will inform 
Merely in hate  gainst any of us all 
That will the king severely prosecute 
Gainst us  our lives  our children  and our heirs 

The commons hath he pilld with grievous taxes 
And quite lost their hearts  the nobles hath he find 
For ancient quarrels  and quite lost their hearts 

And daily new exactions are devisd 
As blanks  benevolences  and I wot not what 
But what  o Gods name  doth become of this 

Wars have not wasted it  for warrd he hath not 
But basely yielded upon compromise 
That which his ancestors achievd with blows 
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars 

The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm 

The kings grown bankrupt  like a broken man 

Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him 

He hath not money for these Irish wars 
His burdenous taxations notwithstanding 
But by the robbing of the banishd duke 

His noble kinsman  most degenerate king 
But  lords  we hear this fearful tempest sing 
Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm 
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails 
And yet we strike not  but securely perish 

We see the very wrack that we must suffer 
And unavoided is the danger now 
For suffering so the causes of our wrack 

Not so  even through the hollow eyes of death 
Ispy life peering  but I dare not say 
How near the tidings of our comfort is 

Nay  let us share thy thoughts  as thou dost ours 

Be confident to speak  Northumberland 
We three are but thyself  and  speaking so 
Thy words are but as thoughts  therefore  be bold 

Then thus  I have from Port le Blanc  a bay 
In Brittany  receivd intelligence 
That Harry Duke of Hereford  Rainold Lord Cobham 
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter 
His brother  Archbishop late of Canterbury 
Sir Thomas Erpingham  Sir John Ramston 
Sir John Norbery  Sir Robert Waterton  and Francis Quoint 
All these well furnishd by the Duke of Britaine 
With eight tall ships  three thousand men of war 
Are making hither with all due expedience 
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore 
Perhaps they had ere this  but that they stay 
The first departing of the king for Ireland 
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke 
Imp out our drooping countrys broken wing 
Redeem from broking pawn the blemishd crown 
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptres gilt 
And make high majesty look like itself 
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh 
But if you faint  as fearing to do so 
Stay and be secret  and myself will go 

To horse  to horse  urge doubts to them that fear 

Hold out my horse  and I will first be there 


Madam  your majesty is too much sad 
You promisd  when you parted with the king 
To lay aside lifeharming heaviness 
And entertain a cheerful disposition 

To please the king I did  to please myself 
I cannot do it  yet I know no cause 
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief 
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest 
As my sweet Richard  yet  again  methinks 
Some unborn sorrow  ripe in fortunes womb 
Is coming towards me  and my inward soul 
With nothing trembles  at some thing it grieves 
More than with parting from my lord the king 

Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows 
Which show like grief itself  but are not so 
For sorrows eye  glazed with blinding tears 
Divides one thing entire to many objects 
Like perspectives  which rightly gazd upon 
Show nothing but confusion  eyd awry 
Distinguish form  so your sweet majesty 
Looking awry upon your lords departure 
Finds shapes of grief more than himself to wail 
Which  lookd on as it is  is nought but shadows 
Of what it is not  Then  thricegracious queen 
More than your lords departure weep not  mores not seen 
Or if it be  tis with false sorrows eye 
Which for things true weeps things imaginary 

It may be so  but yet my inward soul 
Persuades me it is otherwise  howeer it be 
I cannot but be sad  so heavy sad 
As  though in thinking on no thought I think 
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink 

Tis nothing but conceit  my gracious lady 

Tis nothing less  conceit is still derivd 
From some forefather grief  mine is not so 
For nothing hath begot my something grief 
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve 
Tis in reversion that I do possess 
But what it is  that is not yet known  what 
I cannot name  tis nameless woe  I wot 


God save your majesty  and well met  gentlemen 
I hope the king is not yet shippd for Ireland 

Why hopst thou so  tis better hope he is 
For his designs crave haste  his haste good hope 
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shippd 

That he  our hope  might have retird his power 
And driven into despair an enemys hope 
Who strongly hath set footing in this land 
The banishd Bolingbroke repeals himself 
And with uplifted arms is safe arrivd 
At Ravenspurgh 

Now God in heaven forbid 

Ah  madam  tis too true  and that is worse 
The Lord Northumberland  his son young Henry Percy 
The Lords of Ross  Beaumond  and Willoughby 
With all their powerful friends  are fled to him 

Why have you not proclaimd Northumberland 
And all the rest of the revolted faction traitors 

We have  whereupon the Earl of Worcester 
Hath broke his staff  resignd his stewardship 
And all the household servants fled with him 
To Bolingbroke 

So  Green  thou art the midwife to my woe 
And Bolingbroke my sorrows dismal heir 
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy 
And I  a gasping newdeliverd mother 
Have woe to woe  sorrow to sorrow joind 

Despair not  madam 

Who shall hinder me 
I will despair  and be at enmity 
With cozening hope  he is a flatterer 
A parasite  a keeperback of death 
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life 
Which false hope lingers in extremity 


Here comes the Duke of York 

With signs of war about his aged neck 
O  full of careful business are his looks 
Uncle  for Gods sake  speak comfortable words 

Should I do so  I should belie my thoughts 
Comforts in heaven  and we are on the earth 
Where nothing lives but crosses  cares  and grief 
Your husband  he is gone to save far off 
Whilst others come to make him lose at home 
Here am I left to underprop his land 
Who  weak with age  cannot support myself 
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made 
Now shall he try his friends that flatterd him 


My lord  your son was gone before I came 

He was  Why  so  go all which way it will 
The nobles they are fled  the commons they are cold 
And will  I fear  revolt on Herefords side 
Sirrah  get thee to Plashy  to my sister Gloucester 
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound 
Hold  take my ring 

My lord  I had forgot to tell your lordship 
Today  as I came by  I called there 
But I shall grieve you to report the rest 

What ist  knave 

An hour before I came the duchess died 

God for his mercy  what a tide of woes 
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once 
I know not what to do  I would to God 
So my untruth had not provokd him to it 
The king had cut off my head with my brothers 
What  are there no posts dispatchd for Ireland 
How shall we do for money for these wars 
Come  sister cousin  I would say pray  pardon me 
Go  fellow  get thee home  provide some carts 
And bring away the armour that is there 

Gentlemen  will you go muster men  If I know 
How or which way to order these affairs 
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands 
Never believe me  Both are my kinsmen 
The one is my sovereign  whom both my oath 
And duty bids defend  the other again 
Is my kinsman  whom the king hath wrongd 
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right 
Well  somewhat we must do  Come  cousin 
Ill dispose of you  Gentlemen  go muster up your men 
And meet me presently at Berkeley Castle 
I should to Plashy too 
But time will not permit  All is uneven 
And every thing is left at six and seven 


The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland 
But none returns  For us to levy power 
Proportionable to the enemy 
Is all unpossible 

Besides  our nearness to the king in love 
Is near the hate of those love not the king 

And thats the wavering commons  for their love 
Lies in their purses  and whoso empties them 
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate 

Wherein the king stands generally condemnd 

If judgment lie in them  then so do we 
Because we ever have been near the king 

Well  Ill for refuge straight to Bristol Castle 
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there 

Thither will I with you  for little office 
Will the hateful commons perform for us 
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces 
Will you go along with us 

No  I will to Ireland to his majesty 
Farewell  if hearts presages be not vain 
We three here part that neer shall meet again 

Thats as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke 

Alas  poor duke  the task he undertakes 
Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry 
Where one on his side fights  thousands will fly 
Farewell at once  for once  for all  and ever 

Well  we may meet again 

I fear me  never 


How far is it  my lord  to Berkeley now 

Believe me  noble lord 
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire 
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways 
Draw out our miles and make them wearisome 
But yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar 
Making the hard way sweet and delectable 
But I bethink me what a weary way 
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found 
In Ross and Willoughby  wanting your company 
Which  I protest  hath very much beguild 
The tediousness and process of my travel 
But theirs is sweetend with the hope to have 
The present benefit which I possess 
And hope to joy is little less in joy 
Than hope enjoyd  by this the weary lords 
Shall make their way seem short  as mine hath done 
By sight of what I have  your noble company 

Of much less value is my company 
Than your good words  But who comes here 


It is my son  young Harry Percy 
Sent from my brother Worcester  whencesoever 
Harry  how fares your uncle 

I had thought  my lord  to have learnd his health of you 

Why  is he not with the queen 

No  my good lord  he hath forsook the court 
Broken his staff of office  and dispersd 
The household of the king 

What was his reason 
He was not so resolvd when last we spake together 

Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor 
But he  my lord  is gone to Ravenspurgh 
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford 
And sent me over by Berkeley to discover 
What power the Duke of York had levied there 
Then with direction to repair to Ravenspurgh 

Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford  boy 

No  my good lord  for that is not forgot 
Which neer I did remember  to my knowledge 
I never in my life did look on him 

Then learn to know him now  this is the duke 

My gracious lord  I tender you my service 
Such as it is  being tender  raw  and young 
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm 
To more approved service and desert 

I thank thee  gentle Percy  and be sure 
I count myself in nothing else so happy 
As in a soul remembering my good friends 
And as my fortune ripens with thy love 
It shall be still thy true loves recompense 
My heart this covenant makes  my hand thus seals it 

How far is it to Berkeley  and what stir 
Keeps good old York there with his men of war 

There stands the castle  by yon tuft of trees 
Mannd with three hundred men  as I have heard 
And in it are the Lords of York  Berkeley  and Seymour 
None else of name and noble estimate 


Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby 
Bloody with spurring  fieryred with haste 

Welcome  my lords  I wot your love pursues 
A banishd traitor  all my treasury 
Is yet but unfelt thanks  which  more enrichd 
Shall be your love and labours recompense 

Your presence makes us rich  most noble lord 

And far surmounts our labour to attain it 

Evermore thanks  the exchequer of the poor 
Which  till my infant fortune comes to years 
Stands for my bounty  But who comes here 


It is my Lord of Berkeley  as I guess 

My lord of Hereford  my message is to you 

My lord  my answer is to Lancaster 
And I am come to seek that name in England 
And I must find that title in your tongue 
Before I make reply to aught you say 

Mistake me not  my lord  tis not my meaning 
To raze one title of your honour out 
To you  my lord  I come  what lord you will 
From the most gracious regent of this land 
The Duke of York  to know what pricks you on 
To take advantage of the absent time 
And fright our native peace with selfborn arms 


I shall not need transport my words by you 
Here comes his Grace in person 
My noble uncle 


Show me thy humble heart  and not thy knee 
Whose duty is deceivable and false 

My gracious uncle 

Tut  tut 
Grace me no grace  nor uncle me no uncle 
I am no traitors uncle  and that word grace 
In an ungracious mouth is but profane 
Why have those banishd and forbidden legs 
Dard once to touch a dust of Englands ground 
But then  more why  why have they dard to march 
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom 
Frighting her palefacd villages with war 
And ostentation of despised arms 
Comst thou because the anointed king is hence 
Why  foolish boy  the king is left behind 
And in my loyal bosom lies his power 
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth 
As when brave Gaunt thy father  and myself 
Rescud the Black Prince  that young Mars of men 
From forth the ranks of many thousand French 
O  then  how quickly should this arm of mine 
Now prisoner to the palsy  chastise thee 
And minister correction to thy fault 

My gracious uncle  let me know my fault 
On what condition stands it and wherein 

Even in condition of the worst degree 
In gross rebellion and detested treason 
Thou art a banishd man  and here art come 
Before the expiration of thy time 
In braving arms against thy sovereign 

As I was banishd  I was banishd Hereford 
But as I come  I come for Lancaster 
And  noble uncle  I beseech your Grace 
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye 
You are my father  for methinks in you 
I see old Gaunt alive  O  then  my father 
Will you permit that I shall stand condemnd 
A wandering vagabond  my rights and royalties 
Pluckd from my arms perforce and given away 
To upstart unthrifts  Wherefore was I born 
If that my cousin king be King of England 
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster 
You have a son  Aumerle  my noble kinsman 
Had you first died  and he been thus trod down 
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father 
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay 
I am denied to sue my livery here 
And yet my letterspatent give me leave 
My fathers goods are all distraind and sold 
And these and all are all amiss employd 
What would you have me do  I am a subject 
And challenge law  attorneys are denied me 
And therefore personally I lay my claim 
To my inheritance of free descent 

The noble duke hath been too much abusd 

It stands your Grace upon to do him right 

Base men by his endowments are made great 

My lords of England  let me tell you this 
I have had feeling of my cousins wrongs 
And labourd all I could to do him right 
But in this kind to come  in braving arms 
Be his own carver and cut out his way 
To find out right with wrong  it may not be 
And you that do abet him in this kind 
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all 

The noble duke hath sworn his coming is 
But for his own  and for the right of that 
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid 
And let him neer see joy that breaks that oath 

Well  well  I see the issue of these arms 
I cannot mend it  I must needs confess 
Because my power is weak and all ill left 
But if I could  by him that gave me life 
I would attach you all and make you stoop 
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king 
But since I cannot  be it known to you 
I do remain as neuter  So  fare you well 
Unless you please to enter in the castle 
And there repose you for this night 

An offer  uncle  that we will accept 
But we must win your Grace to go with us 
To Bristol Castle  which they say is held 
By Bushy  Bagot  and their complices 
The caterpillars of the commonwealth 
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away 

It may be I will go with you  but yet Ill pause 
For I am loath to break our countrys laws 
Nor friends nor foes  to me welcome you are 
Things past redress are now with me past care 


My Lord of Salisbury  we have stayd ten days 
And hardly kept our countrymen together 
And yet we hear no tidings from the king 
Therefore we will disperse ourselves  farewell 

Stay yet another day  thou trusty Welshman 
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee 

Tis thought the king is dead  we will not stay 
The baytrees in our country are all witherd 
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven 
The palefacd moon looks bloody on the earth 
And leanlookd prophets whisper fearful change 
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap 
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy 
The other to enjoy by rage and war 
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings 
Farewell  our countrymen are gone and fled 
As well assurd Richard their king is dead 


Ah  Richard  with the eyes of heavy mind 
I see thy glory like a shooting star 
Fall to the base earth from the firmament 
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west 
Witnessing storms to come  woe  and unrest 
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes 
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes 


Bring forth these men 
Bushy and Green  I will not vex your souls 
Since presently your souls must part your bodies 
With too much urging your pernicious lives 
For twere no charity  yet  to wash your blood 
From off my hands  here in the view of men 
I will unfold some causes of your deaths 
You have misled a prince  a royal king 
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments 
By you unhappied and disfigurd clean 
You have in manner with your sinful hours 
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him 
Broke the possession of a royal bed 
And staind the beauty of a fair queens cheeks 
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs 
Myself  a prince by fortune of my birth 
Near to the king in blood  and near in love 
Till you did make him misinterpret me 
Have stoopd my neck under your injuries 
And sighd my English breath in foreign clouds 
Eating the bitter bread of banishment 
Whilst you have fed upon my signories 
Disparkd my parks  and felled my forest woods 
From mine own windows torn my household coat 
Razd out my impress  leaving me no sign 
Save mens opinions and my living blood 
To show the world I am a gentleman 
This and much more  much more than twice all this 
Condemns you to the death  See them deliverd over 
To execution and the hand of death 

More welcome is the stroke of death to me 
Than Bolingbroke to England  Lords  farewell 

My comfort is  that heaven will take our souls 
And plague injustice with the pains of hell 

My Lord Northumberland  see them dispatchd 

Uncle  you say the queen is at your house 
For Gods sake  fairly let her be entreated 
Tell her I send to her my kind commends 
Take special care my greetings be deliverd 

A gentleman of mine I have dispatchd 
With letters of your love to her at large 

Thanks  gentle uncle  Come  lords  away 
To fight with Glendower and his complices 
Awhile to work  and after holiday 


Barkloughly Castle call they this at hand 

Yea  my lord  How brooks your Grace the air 
After your late tossing on the breaking seas 

Needs must I like it well  I weep for joy 
To stand upon my kingdom once again 
Dear earth  I do salute thee with my hand 
Though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs 
As a longparted mother with her child 
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting 
So  weeping  smiling  greet I thee  my earth 
And do thee favour with my royal hands 
Feed not thy sovereigns foe  my gentle earth 
Nor with thy sweets comfort his revenous sense 
But let thy spiders  that suck up thy venom 
And heavygaited toads lie in their way 
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet 
Which with usurping steps do trample thee 
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies 
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower 
Guard it  I pray thee  with a lurking adder 
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch 
Throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies 
Mock not my senseless conjuration  lords 
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones 
Prove armed soldiers  ere her native king 
Shall falter under foul rebellions arms 

Fear not  my lord  that power that made you king 
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all 
The means that heaven yields must be embracd 
And not neglected  else  if heaven would 
And we will not  heavens offer we refuse 
The profferd means of succour and redress 

He means  my lord  that we are too remiss 
Whilst Bolingbroke  through our security 
Grows strong and great in substance and in friends 

Discomfortable cousin  knowst thou not 
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid 
Behind the globe  and lights the lower world 
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen 
In murders and in outrage bloody here 
But when  from under this terrestrial ball 
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines 
And darts his light through every guilty hole 
Then murders  treasons  and detested sins 
The cloak of night being pluckd from off their backs 
Stand bare and naked  trembling at themselves 
So when this thief  this traitor  Bolingbroke 
Who all this while hath revelld in the night 
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes 
Shall see us rising in our throne  the east 
His treasons will sit blushing in his face 
Not able to endure the sight of day 
But selfaffrighted tremble at his sin 
Not all the water in the rough rude sea 
Can wash the balm from an anointed king 
The breath of worldly men cannot depose 
The deputy elected by the Lord 
For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressd 
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown 
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay 
A glorious angel  then  if angels fight 
Weak men must fall  for heaven still guards the right 

Welcome  my lord  how far off lies your power 

Nor near nor further off  my gracious lord 
Than this weak arm  discomfort guides my tongue 
And bids me speak of nothing but despair 
One day too late  I fear me  noble lord 
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth 
O  call back yesterday  bid time return 
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men 
Today  today  unhappy day too late 
Oerthrows thy joys  friends  fortune  and thy state 
For all the Welshmen  hearing thou wert dead 
Are gone to Bolingbroke  dispersd  and fled 

Comfort  my liege  why looks your Grace so pale 

But now  the blood of twenty thousand men 
Did triumph in my face  and they are fled 
And till so much blood thither come again 
Have I not reason to look pale and dead 
All souls that will be safe  fly from my side 
For time hath set a blot upon my pride 

Comfort  my liege  remember who you are 

I had forgot myself  Am I not king 
Awake  thou sluggard majesty  thou sleepest 
Is not the kings name twenty thousand names 
Arm  arm  my name  a puny subject strikes 
At thy great glory  Look not to the ground 
Ye favourites of a king  are we not high 
High be our thoughts  I know my uncle York 
Hath power enough to serve our turn  But who comes here 


More health and happiness betide my liege 
Than can my caretund tongue deliver him 

Mine ear is open and my heart prepard 
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold 
Say  is my kingdom lost  why  twas my care 
And what loss is it to be rid of care 
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we 
Greater he shall not be  if he serve God 
Well serve him too  and be his fellow so 
Revolt our subjects  that we cannot mend 
They break their faith to God as well as us 
Cry woe  destruction  ruin  loss  decay 
The worst is death  and death will have his day 

Glad am I that your highness is so armd 
To bear the tidings of calamity 
Like an unseasonable stormy day 
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores 
As if the world were all dissolvd to tears 
So high above his limits swells the rage 
Of Bolingbroke  covering your fearful land 
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel 
Whitebeards have armd their thin and hairless scalps 
Against thy majesty  and boys  with womens voices 
Strive to speak big  and clap their female joints 
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown 
Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows 
Of doublefatal yew against thy state 
Yea  distaffwomen manage rusty bills 
Against thy seat  both young and old rebel 
And all goes worse than I have power to tell 

Too well  too well thou tellst a tale so ill 
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire  where is Bagot 
What is become of Bushy  where is Green 
That they have let the dangerous enemy 
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps 
If we prevail  their heads shall pay for it 
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke 

Peace have they made with him  indeed  my lord 

O villains  vipers  damnd without redemption 
Dogs  easily won to fawn on any man 
Snakes  in my heartblood warmd  that sting my heart 
Three Judases  each one thrice worse than Judas 
Would they make peace  terrible hell make war 
Upon their spotted souls for this offence 

Sweet love  I see  changing his property 
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate 
Again uncurse their souls  their peace is made 
With heads and not with hands  those whom you curse 
Have felt the worst of deaths destroying wound 
And lie full low  gravd in the hollow ground 

Is Bushy  Green  and the Earl of Wiltshire dead 

Yea  all of them at Bristol lost their heads 

Where is the duke my father with his power 

No matter where  Of comfort no man speak 
Lets talk of graves  of worms  and epitaphs 
Make dust our paper  and with rainy eyes 
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth 
Lets choose executors and talk of wills 
And yet not so for what can we bequeath 
Save our deposed bodies to the ground 
Our lands  our lives  and all are Bolingbrokes 
And nothing can we call our own but death 
And that small model of the barren earth 
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones 
For Gods sake  let us sit upon the ground 
And tell sad stories of the death of kings 
How some have been deposd  some slain in war 
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposd 
Some poisond by their wives  some sleeping killd 
All murderd  for within the hollow crown 
That rounds the mortal temples of a king 
Keeps Death his court  and there the antick sits 
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp 
Allowing him a breath  a little scene 
To monarchize  be feard  and kill with looks 
Infusing him with self and vain conceit 
As if this flesh which walls about our life 
Were brass impregnable  and humourd thus 
Comes at the last  and with a little pin 
Bores through his castle wall  and farewell king 
Cover your heads  and mock not flesh and blood 
With solemn reverence  throw away respect 
Tradition  form  and ceremonious duty 
For you have but mistook me all this while 
I live with bread like you  feel want 
Taste grief  need friends  subjected thus 
How can you say to me I am a king 

My lord  wise men neer sit and wail their woes 
But presently prevent the ways to wail 
To fear the foe  since fear oppresseth strength 
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe 
And so your follies fight against yourself 
Fear and be slain  no worse can come to fight 
And fight and die is death destroying death 
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath 

My father hath a power  inquire of him 
And learn to make a body of a limb 

Thou chidst me well  Proud Boling broke  I come 
To change blows with thee for our day of doom 
This aguefit of fear is overblown 
An easy task it is  to win our own 
Say  Scroop  where lies our uncle with his power 
Speak sweetly  man  although thy looks be sour 

Men judge by the complexion of the sky 
The state and inclination of the day 
So may you by my dull and heavy eye 
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say 
I play the torturer  by small and small 
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken 
Your uncle York is joind with Bolingbroke 
And all your northern castles yielded up 
And all your southern gentlemen in arms 
Upon his party 

Thou hast said enough 


Beshrew thee  cousin  which didst lead me forth 
Of that sweet way I was in to despair 
What say you now  What comfort have we now 
By heaven  Ill hate him everlastingly 
That bids me be of comfort any more 
Go to Flint Castle  there Ill pine away 
A king  woes slave  shall kingly woe obey 
That power I have  discharge  and let them go 
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow 
For I have none  let no man speak again 
To alter this  for counsel is but vain 

My liege  one word 

He does me double wrong 
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue 
Discharge my followers  let them hence away 
From Richards night to Bolingbrokes fair day 


So that by this intelligence we learn 
The Welshmen are dispersd and Salisbury 
Is gone to meet the king  who lately landed 
With some few private friends upon this coast 

The news is very fair and good  my lord 
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head 

It would beseem the Lord Northumberland 
To say  King Richard  alack the heavy day 
When such a sacred king should hide his head 

Your Grace mistakes  only to be brief 
Left I his title out 

The time hath been 
Would you have been so brief with him  he would 
Have been so brief with you  to shorten you 
For taking so the head  your whole heads length 

Mistake not  uncle  further than you should 

Take not  good cousin  further than you should 
Lest you mistake the heavens are oer our heads 

I know it  uncle  and oppose not myself 
Against their will  But who comes here 

Welcome  Harry  what  will not this castle yield 

The castle royally is mannd  my lord 
Against thy entrance 

Royally 
Why  it contains no king 

Yes  my good lord 
It doth contain a king  King Richard lies 
Within the limits of yon lime and stone 
And with him are the Lord Aumerle  Lord Salisbury 
Sir Stephen Scroop  besides a clergyman 
Of holy reverence  who  I cannot learn 

O  belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle 

Noble lord 
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle 
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley 
Into his ruind ears  and thus deliver 
Henry Bolingbroke 
On both his knees doth kiss King Richards hand 
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart 
To his most royal person  hither come 
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power 
Provided that my banishment repeald 
And lands restord again be freely granted 
If not  Ill use the advantage of my power 
And lay the summers dust with showers of blood 
Raind from the wounds of slaughterd Englishmen 
The which  how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke 
It is  such crimson tempest should bedrench 
The fresh green lap of fair King Richards land 
My stooping duty tenderly shall show 
Go  signify as much  while here we march 
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain 
Lets march without the noise of threatning drum 
That from the castles totterd battlements 
Our fair appointments may be well perusd 
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet 
With no less terror than the elements 
Of fire and water  when their thundering shock 
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven 
Be he the fire  Ill be the yielding water 
The rage be his  while on the earth I rain 
My waters  on the earth  and not on him 
March on  and mark King Richard how he looks 


See  see  King Richard doth himself appear 
As doth the blushing discontented sun 
From out the fiery portal of the east 
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent 
To dim his glory and to stain the track 
Of his bright passage to the occident 

Yet looks he like a king  behold  his eye 
As bright as is the eagles  lightens forth 
Controlling majesty  alack  alack  for woe 
That any harm should stain so fair a show 

We are amazd  and thus long have we stood 
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee 
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king 
And if we be  how dare thy joints forget 
To pay their awful duty to our presence 
If we be not  show us the hand of God 
That hath dismissd us from our stewardship 
For well we know  no hand of blood and bone 
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre 
Unless he do profane  steal  or usurp 
And though you think that all  as you have done 
Have torn their souls by turning them from us 
And we are barren and bereft of friends 
Yet know  my master  God omnipotent 
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf 
Armies of pestilence  and they shall strike 
Your children yet unborn and unbegot 
That lift your vassal hands against my head 
And threat the glory of my precious crown 
Tell Bolingbroke for yond methinks he is 
That every stride he makes upon my land 
Is dangerous treason  he is come to open 
The purple testament of bleeding war 
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace 
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons 
Shall ill become the flower of Englands face 
Change the complexion of her maidpale peace 
To scarlet indignation  and bedew 
Her pastures grass with faithful English blood 

The king of heaven forbid our lord the king 
Should so with civil and uncivil arms 
Be rushd upon  Thy thricenoble cousin 
Harry Bolingbroke  doth humbly kiss thy hand 
And by the honourable tomb he swears 
That stands upon your royal grandsires bones 
And by the royalties of both your bloods 
Currents that spring from one most gracious head 
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt 
And by the worth and honour of himself 
Comprising all that may be sworn or said 
His coming hither hath no further scope 
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg 
Enfranchisement immediate on his knees 
Which on thy royal party granted once 
His glittering arms he will commend to rust 
His barbed steeds to stables  and his heart 
To faithful service of your majesty 
This swears he  as he is a prince  is just 
And  as I am a gentleman  I credit him 

Northumberland  say  thus the king returns 
His noble cousin is right welcome hither 
And all the number of his fair demands 
Shall be accomplishd without contradiction 
With all the gracious utterance thou hast 
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends 

We do debase ourself  cousin  do we not 
To look so poorly and to speak so fair 
Shall we call back Northumberland and send 
Defiance to the traitor  and so die 

No  good my lord  lets fight with gentle words 
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords 

O God  O God  that eer this tongue of mine 
That laid the sentence of dread banishment 
On yond proud man  should take it off again 
With words of sooth  O  that I were as great 
As is my grief  or lesser than my name 
Or that I could forget what I have been 
Or not remember what I must be now 
Swellst thou  proud heart  Ill give thee scope to beat 
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me 

Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke 

What must the king do now  Must he submit 
The king shall do it  must he be deposd 
The king shall be contented  must he lose 
The name of king  o Gods name  let it go 
Ill give my jewels for a set of beads 
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage 
My gay apparel for an almsmans gown 
My figurd goblets for a dish of wood 
My sceptre for a palmers walkingstaff 
My subjects for a pair of carved saints 
And my large kingdom for a little grave 
A little little grave  an obscure grave 
Or Ill be buried in the kings highway 
Some way of common trade  where subjects feet 
May hourly trample on their sovereigns head 
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live 
And buried once  why not upon my head 
Aumerle  thou weepst  my tenderhearted cousin 
Well make foul weather with despised tears 
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn 
And make a dearth in this revolting land 
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes 
And make some pretty match with shedding tears 
As thus  to drop them still upon one place 
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves 
Within the earth  and  there inlaid  There lies 
Two kinsmen diggd their graves with weeping eyes  
Would not this ill do well  Well  well  I see 
I talk but idly and you laugh at me 
Most mighty prince  my Lord Northumberland 
What says King Bolingbroke  will his majesty 
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die 
You make a leg  and Bolingbroke says ay 

My lord  in the base court he doth attend 
To speak with you  mayt please you to come down 

Down  down  I come  like glistering Phaethon 
Wanting the manage of unruly jades 
In the base court  Base court  where kings grow base 
To come at traitors calls and do them grace 
In the base court  Come down  Down  court  down  king 
For nightowls shriek where mounting larks should sing 


What says his majesty 

Sorrow and grief of heart 
Makes him speak fondly  like a frantic man 
Yet he is come 


Stand all apart 
And show fair duty to his majesty 

My gracious lord 

Fair cousin  you debase your princely knee 
To make the base earth proud with kissing it 
Me rather had my heart might feel your love 
Than my unpleasd eye see your courtesy 
Up  cousin  up  your heart is up  I know 
Thus high at least  although your knee be low 

My gracious lord  I come but for mine own 

Your own is yours  and I am yours  and all 

So far be mine  my most redoubted lord 
As my true service shall deserve your love 

Well you deserve  they well deserve to have 
That know the strongst and surest way to get 
Uncle  give me your hand  nay  dry your eyes 
Tears show their love  but want their remedies 
Cousin  I am too young to be your father 
Though you are old enough to be my heir 
What you will have Ill give  and willing too 
For do we must what force will have us do 
Set on towards London  Cousin  is it so 

Yea  my good lord 

Then I must not say no 


What sport shall we devise here in this garden 
To drive away the heavy thought of care 

Madam  well play at bowls 

Twill make me think the world is full of rubs 
And that my fortune runs against the bias 

Madam  well dance 

My legs can keep no measure in delight 
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief 
Therefore  no dancing  girl  some other sport 

Madam  well tell tales 

Of sorrow or of joy 

Of either  madam 

Of neither  girl 
For if of joy  being altogether wanting 
It doth remember me the more of sorrow 
Or if of grief  being altogether had 
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy 
For what I have I need not to repeat 
And what I want it boots not to complain 

Madam  Ill sing 

Tis well that thou hast cause 
But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep 

I could weep  madam  would it do you good 

And I could sing would weeping do me good 
And never borrow any tear of thee 
But stay  here come the gardeners 
Lets step into the shadow of these trees 
My wretchedness unto a row of pins 
Theyll talk of state  for every one doth so 
Against a change  woe is forerun with woe 

Go  bind thou up yon dangling apricocks 
Which  like unruly children  make their sire 
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight 
Give some supportance to the bending twigs 
Go thou  and like an executioner 
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays 
That look too lofty in our commonwealth 
All must be even in our government 
You thus employd  I will go root away 
The noisome weeds  that without profit suck 
The soils fertility from wholesome flowers 

Why should we in the compass of a pale 
Keep law and form and due proportion 
Showing  as in a model  our firm estate 
When our seawalled garden  the whole land 
Is full of weeds  her fairest flowers chokd up 
Her fruittrees all unprund  her hedges ruind 
Her knots disorderd  and her wholesome herbs 
Swarming with caterpillars 

Hold thy peace 
He that hath sufferd this disorderd spring 
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf 
The weeds that his broadspreading leaves did shelter 
That seemd in eating him to hold him up 
Are pluckd up root and all by Bolingbroke 
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire  Bushy  Green 

What  are they dead 

They are  and Bolingbroke 
Hath seizd the wasteful king  O  what pity is it 
That he hath not so trimmd and dressd his land 
As we this garden  We at time of year 
Do wound the bark  the skin of our fruittrees 
Lest  being overproud with sap and blood 
With too much riches it confound itself 
Had he done so to great and growing men 
They might have livd to bear and he to taste 
Their fruits of duty  superfluous branches 
We lop away that bearing boughs may live 
Had he done so  himself had borne the crown 
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down 

What  think you then the king shall be deposd 

Depressd he is already  and deposd 
Tis doubt he will be  letters came last night 
To a dear friend of the good Duke of Yorks 
That tell black tidings 

O  I am pressd to death through want of speaking 

Thou  old Adams likeness  set to dress this garden 
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news 
What Eve  what serpent  hath suggested thee 
To make a second fall of cursed man 
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposd 
Darst thou  thou little better thing than earth 
Divine his downfall  Say  where  when  and how 
Camst thou by these ill tidings  speak  thou wretch 

Pardon me  madam  little joy have I 
To breathe these news  yet what I say is true 
King Richard  he is in the mighty hold 
Of Bolingbroke  their fortunes both are weighd 
In your lords scale is nothing but himself 
And some few vanities that make him light 
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke 
Besides himself  are all the English peers 
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down 
Post you to London and youll find it so 
I speak no more than every one doth know 

Nimble mischance  that art so light of foot 
Doth not thy embassage belong to me 
And am I last that knows it  O  thou thinkst 
To serve me last  that I may longest keep 
Thy sorrow in my breast  Come  ladies  go 
To meet at London Londons king in woe 
What  was I born to this  that my sad look 
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke 
Gardener  for telling me these news of woe 
Pray God the plants thou graftst may never grow 


Poor queen  so that thy state might be no worse 
I would my skill were subject to thy curse 
Here did she fall a tear  here  in this place 
Ill set a bank of rue  sour herb of grace 
Rue  even for ruth  here shortly shall be seen 
In the remembrance of a weeping queen 

Call forth Bagot 
Now  Bagot  freely speak thy mind 
What thou dost know of noble Gloucesters death 
Who wrought it with the king  and who performd 
The bloody office of his timeless end 

Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle 

Cousin  stand forth  and look upon that man 

My Lord Aumerle  I know your daring tongue 
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliverd 
In that dead time when Gloucesters death was plotted 
I heard you say  Is not my arm of length 
That reacheth from the restful English court 
As far as Calais  to my uncles head  
Amongst much other talk  that very time 
I heard you say that you had rather refuse 
The offer of a hundred thousand crowns 
Than Bolingbrokes return to England 
Adding withal  how blest this land would be 
In this your cousins death 

Princes and noble lords 
What answer shall I make to this base man 
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars 
On equal terms to give him chastisement 
Either I must  or have mine honour soild 
With the attainder of his slanderous lips 
There is my gage  the manual seal of death 
That marks thee out for hell  I say thou liest 
And will maintain what thou hast said is false 
In thy heartblood  though being all too base 
To stain the temper of my knightly sword 

Bagot  forbear  thou shalt not take it up 

Excepting one  I would he were the best 
In all this presence that hath movd me so 

If that thy valour stand on sympathies 
There is my gage  Aumerle  in gage to thine 
By that fair sun which shows me where thou standst 
I heard thee say  and vauntingly thou spakst it 
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucesters death 
If thou denyst it twenty times  thou liest 
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart 
Where it was forged  with my rapiers point 

Thou darst not  coward  live to see that day 

Now  by my soul  I would it were this hour 

Fitzwater  thou art damnd to hell for this 

Aumerle  thou liest  his honour is as true 
In this appeal as thou art all unjust 
And that thou art so  there I throw my gage 
To prove it on thee to the extremest point 
Of mortal breathing  seize it if thou darst 

And if I do not may my hands rot off 
And never brandish more revengeful steel 
Over the glittering helmet of my foe 

I task the earth to the like  forsworn Aumerle 
And spur thee on with full as many lies 
As may be hollad in thy treacherous ear 
From sun to sun  there is my honours pawn 
Engage it to the trial if thou darst 

Who sets me else  by heaven  Ill throw at all 
I have a thousand spirits in one breast 
To answer twenty thousand such as you 

My Lord Fitzwater  I do remember well 
The very time Aumerle and you did talk 

Tis very true  you were in presence then 
And you can witness with me this is true 

As false  by heaven  as heaven itself is true 

Surrey  thou best 

Dishonourable boy 
That he shall lie so heavy on my sword 
That it shall render vengeance and revenge 
Till thou the liegiver and that lie do lie 
In earth as quiet as thy fathers skull 
In proof whereof  there is my honours pawn 
Engage it to the trial if thou darst 

How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse 
If I dare eat  or drink  or breathe  or live 
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness 
And spit upon him  whilst I say he lies 
And lies  and lies  there is my bond of faith 
To tie thee to my strong correction 
As I intend to thrive in this new world 
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal 
Besides  I heard the banishd Norfolk say 
That thou  Aumerle  didst send two of thy men 
To execute the noble duke at Calais 

Some honest Christian trust me with a gage 
That Norfolk lies  here do I throw down this 
If he may be repeald to try his honour 

These differences shall all rest under gage 
Till Norfolk be repeald  repeald he shall be 
And though mine enemy  restord again 
To all his lands and signories  when hes returnd 
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial 

That honourable day shall neer be seen 
Many a time hath banishd Norfolk fought 
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field 
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross 
Against black pagans  Turks  and Saracens 
And toild with works of war  retird himself 
To Italy  and there at Venice gave 
His body to that pleasant countrys earth 
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ 
Under whose colours he had fought so long 

Why  bishop  is Norfolk dead 

As surely as I live  my lord 

Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom 
Of good old Abraham  Lords appellants 
Your differences shall all rest under gage 
Till we assign you to your days of trial 


Great Duke of Lancaster  I come to thee 
From plumepluckd Richard  who with willing soul 
Adopts thee heir  and his high sceptre yields 
To the possession of thy royal hand 
Ascend his throne  descending now from him 
And long live Henry  of that name the fourth 

In Gods name  Ill ascend the regal throne 

Marry  God forbid 
Worst in this royal presence may I speak 
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth 
Would God that any in this noble presence 
Were enough noble to be upright judge 
Of noble Richard  then  true noblesse would 
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong 
What subject can give sentence on his king 
And who sits here that is not Richards subject 
Thieves are not judgd but they are by to hear 
Although apparent guilt be seen in them 
And shall the figure of Gods majesty 
His captain  steward  deputy elect 
Anointed  crowned  planted many years 
Be judgd by subject and inferior breath 
And he himself not present  O  forfend it  God 
That in a Christian climate souls refind 
Should show so heinous  black  obscene a deed 
I speak to subjects  and a subject speaks 
Stirrd up by God thus boldly for his king 
My Lord of Hereford here  whom you call king 
Is a foul traitor to proud Herefords king 
And if you crown him  let me prophesy 
The blood of English shall manure the ground 
And future ages groan for this foul act 
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels 
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars 
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound 
Disorder  horror  fear and mutiny 
Shall here inhabit  and this land be calld 
The field of Golgotha and dead mens skulls 
O  if you rear this house against this house 
It will the woefullest division prove 
That ever fell upon this cursed earth 
Prevent it  resist it  let it not be so 
Lest child  childs children  cry against you woe  

Well have you argud  sir  and  for your pains 
Of capital treason we arrest you here 
My Lord of Westminster  be it your charge 
To keep him safely till his day of trial 
May it please you  lords  to grant the commons suit 

Fetch hither Richard  that in common view 
He may surrender  so we shall proceed 
Without suspicion 

I will be his conduct 


Lords  you that here are under our arrest 
Procure your sureties for your days of answer 


Little are we beholding to your love 
And little lookd for at your helping hands 


Alack  why am I sent for to a king 
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts 
Wherewith I reignd  I hardly yet have learnd 
To insinuate  flatter  bow  and bend my limbs 
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me 
To this submission  Yet I well remember 
The favours of these men  were they not mine 
Did they not sometime cry  All haill to me 
So Judas did to Christ  but he  in twelve 
Found truth in all but one  I  in twelve thousand  none 
God save the king  Will no man say  amen 
Am I both priest and clerk  well then  amen 
God save the king  although I be not he 
And yet  amen  if heaven do think him me 
To do what service am I sent for hither 

To do that office of thine own good will 
Which tired majesty did make thee offer 
The resignation of thy state and crown 
To Henry Bolingbroke 

Give me the crown  Here  cousin  seize the crown 
Here cousin 
On this side my hand and on that side thine 
Now is this golden crown like a deep well 
That owes two buckets filling one another 
The emptier ever dancing in the air 
The other down  unseen and full of water 
That bucket down and full of tears am I 
Drinking my griefs  whilst you mount up on high 

I thought you had been willing to resign 

My crown  I am  but still my griefs are mine 
You may my glories and my state depose 
But not my griefs  still am I king of those 

Part of your cares you give me with your crown 

Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down 
My care is loss of care  by old care done 
Your care is gain of care  by new care won 
The cares I give I have  though given away 
They tend the crown  yet still with me they stay 

Are you contented to resign the crown 

Ay  no  no  ay  for I must nothing be 
Therefore no no  for I resign to thee 
Now mark me how I will undo myself 
I give this heavy weight from off my head 
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand 
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart 
With mine own tears I wash away my balm 
With mine own hands I give away my crown 
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state 
With mine own breath release all duteous rites 
All pomp and majesty I do forswear 
My manors  rents  revenues  I forego 
My acts  decrees  and statutes I deny 
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me 
God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee 
Make me  that nothing have  with nothing grievd 
And thou with all pleasd  that hast all achievd 
Long mayst thou live in Richards seat to sit 
And soon lie Richard in an earthy pit 
God save King Henry  unkingd Richard says 
And send him many years of sunshine days 
What more remains 

No more  but that you read 
These accusations and these grievous crimes 
Committed by your person and your followers 
Against the state and profit of this land 
That  by confessing them  the souls of men 
May deem that you are worthily deposd 

Must I do so  and must I ravel out 
My weavdup follies  Gentle Northumberland 
If thy offences were upon record 
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop 
To read a lecture of them  If thou wouldst 
There shouldst thou find one heinous article 
Containing the deposing of a king 
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath 
Markd with a blot  damnd in the book of heaven 
Nay  all of you that stand and look upon me 
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself 
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands 
Showing an outward pity  yet you Pilates 
Have here deliverd me to my sour cross 
And water cannot wash away your sin 

My lord  dispatch  read oer these articles 

Mine eyes are full of tears  I cannot see 
And yet salt water blinds them not so much 
But they can see a sort of traitors here 
Nay  if I turn mine eyes upon myself 
I find myself a traitor with the rest 
For I have given here my souls consent 
To undeck the pompous body of a king 
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave 
Proud majesty a subject  state a peasant 

My lord 

No lord of thine  thou haught insulting man 
Nor no mans lord  I have no name  no title 
No  not that name was given me at the font 
But tis usurpd  alack the heavy day 
That I have worn so many winters out 
And know not now what name to call myself 
O  that I were a mockery king of snow 
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke 
To melt myself away in waterdrops 
Good king  great king and yet not greatly good 
An if my word be sterling yet in England 
Let it command a mirror hither straight 
That it may show me what a face I have 
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty 

Go some of you and fetch a lookingglass 


Read oer this paper while the glass doth come 

Fiend  thou tormentst me ere I come to hell 

Urge it no more  my Lord Northumberland 

The commons will not then be satisfied 

They shall be satisfied  Ill read enough 
When I do see the very book indeed 
Where all my sins are writ  and thats myself 


Give me the glass  and therein will I read 
No deeper wrinkles yet  Hath sorrow struck 
So many blows upon this face of mine 
And made no deeper wounds  O  flattering glass 
Like to my followers in prosperity 
Thou dost beguile me  Was this face the face 
That every day under his household roof 
Did keep ten thousand men  Was this the face 
That like the sun did make beholders wink 
Was this the face that facd so many follies 
And was at last outfacd by Bolingbroke 
A brittle glory shineth in this face 
As brittle as the glory is the face 

For there it is  crackd in a hundred shivers 
Mark  silent king  the moral of this sport 

How soon my sorrow hath destroyd my face 

The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyd 
The shadow of your face 

Say that again 
The shadow of my sorrow  Ha  lets see 
Tis very true  my grief lies all within 
And these external manners of laments 
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief 
That swells with silence in the torturd soul 
There lies the substance  and I thank thee  king 
For thy great bounty  that not only givst 
Me cause to wail  but teachest me the way 
How to lament the cause  Ill beg one boon 
And then be gone and trouble you no more 
Shall I obtain it 

Name it  fair cousin 

Fair cousin  I am greater than a king 
For when I was a king  my flatterers 
Were then but subjects  being now a subject 
I have a king here to my flatterer 
Being so great  I have no need to beg 

Yet ask 

And shall I have 

You shall 

Then give me leave to go 

Whither 

Whither you will  so I were from your sights 

Go  some of you convey him to the Tower 

O  good  convey  conveyers are you all 
That rise thus nimbly by a true kings fall 


On Wednesday next we solemnly set down 
Our coronation  lords  prepare yourselves 


A woeful pageant have we here beheld 

The woes to come  the children yet unborn 
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn 

You holy clergymen  is there no plot 
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot 

My lord 
Before I freely speak my mind herein 
You shall not only take the sacrament 
To bury mine intents  but also to effect 
Whatever I shall happen to devise 
I see your brows are full of discontent 
Your hearts of sorrow  and your eyes of tears 
Come home with me to supper  I will lay 
A plot shall show us all a merry day 

This way the king will come  this is the way 
To Julius C sars illerected tower 
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord 
Is doomd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke 
Here let us rest  if this rebellious earth 
Have any resting for her true kings queen 


But soft  but see  or rather do not see 
My fair rose wither  yet look up  behold 
That you in pity may dissolve to dew 
And wash him fresh again with truelove tears 
Ah  thou  the model where old Troy did stand 
Thou map of honour  thou King Richards tomb 
And not King Richard  thou most beauteous inn 
Why should hardfavourd grief be lodgd in thee 

When triumph is become an alehouse guest 

Join not with grief  fair woman  do not so 
To make my end too sudden  learn  good soul 
To think our former state a happy dream 
From which awakd  the truth of what we are 
Shows us but this  I am sworn brother  sweet 
To grim Necessity  and he and I 
Will keep a league till death  Hie thee to France 
And cloister thee in some religious house 
Our holy lives must win a new worlds crown 
Which our profane hours here have stricken down 

What  is my Richard both in shape and mind 
Transformd and weakend  Hath Bolingbroke deposd 
Thine intellect  hath he been in thy heart 
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw 
And wounds the earth  if nothing else  with rage 
To be oerpowerd  and wilt thou  pupillike 
Take thy correction mildly  kiss the rod 
And fawn on rage with base humility 
Which art a lion and a king of beasts 

A king of beasts indeed  if aught but beasts 
I had been still a happy king of men 
Good sometime queen  prepare thee hence for France 
Think I am dead  and that even here thou takst 
As from my deathbed  my last living leave 
In winters tedious nights sit by the fire 
With good old folks  and let them tell thee tales 
Of woeful ages  long ago betid 
And ere thou bid good night  to quit their grief 
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me 
And send the hearers weeping to their beds 
For why the senseless brands will sympathize 
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue 
And in compassion weep the fire out 
And some will mourn in ashes  some coalblack 
For the deposing of a rightful king 


My lord  the mind of Bolingbroke is changd 
You must to Pomfret  not unto the Tower 
And  madam  there is order taen for you 
With all swift speed you must away to France 

Northumberland  thou ladder wherewithal 
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne 
The time shall not be many hours of age 
More than it is  ere foul sin gathering head 
Shall break into corruption  Thou shalt think 
Though he divide the realm and give thee half 
It is too little  helping him to all 
And he shall think that thou  which knowst the way 
To plant unrightful kings  wilt know again 
Being neer so little urgd  another way 
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne 
The love of wicked friends converts to fear 
That fear to hate  and hate turns one or both 
To worthy danger and deserved death 

My guilt be on my head  and there an end 
Take leave and part  for you must part forthwith 

Doubly divorcd  Bad men  ye violate 
A twofold marriage  twixt my crown and me 
And then  betwixt me and my married wife 
Let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me 
And yet not so  for with a kiss twas made 
Part us  Northumberland  I towards the north 
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime 
My wife to France  from whence  set forth in pomp 
She came adorned hither like sweet May 
Sent back like Hallowmas or shortst of day 

And must we be divided  must we part 

Ay  hand from hand  my love  and heart from heart 

Banish us both and send the king with me 

That were some love but little policy 

Then whither he goes  thither let me go 

So two  together weeping  make one woe 
Weep thou for me in France  I for thee here 
Better far off  than near  be neer the near 
Go  count thy way with sighs  I mine with groans 

So longest way shall have the longest moans 

Twice for one step Ill groan  the way being short 
And piece the way out with a heavy heart 
Come  come  in wooing sorrow lets be brief 
Since  wedding it  thero is such length in grief 
One kiss shall stop our mouths  and dumbly part 
Thus give I mine  and thus take I thy heart 


Give me mine own again  twere no good part 
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart 

So  now I have mine own again  be gone 
That I may strive to kill it with a groan 

We make woe wanton with this fond delay 
Once more  adieu  the rest let sorrow say 


My lord  you told me you would tell the rest 
When weeping made you break the story off 
Of our two cousins coming into London 

Where did I leave 

At that sad stop  my lord 
Where rude misgovernd hands  from windows tops 
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richards head 

Then  as I said  the duke  great Bolingbroke 
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed 
Which his aspiring rider seemd to know 
With slow but stately pace kept on his course 
While all tongues cried  God save thee  Bolingbroke  
You would have thought the very windows spake 
So many greedy looks of young and old 
Through casements darted their desiring eyes 
Upon his visage  and that all the walls 
With painted imagery had said at once 
Jesu preserve thee  welcome  Bolingbroke  
Whilst he  from one side to the other turning 
Bareheaded  lower than his proud steeds neck 
Bespake them thus  I thank you  countrymen  
And thus still doing  thus he passd along 

Alack  poor Richard  where rode he the whilst 

As in a theatre  the eyes of men 
After a wellgracd actor leaves the stage 
Are idly bent on him that enters next 
Thinking his prattle to be tedious 
Even so  or with much more contempt  mens eyes 
Did scowl on Richard  no man cried  God save him  
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home 
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head 
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off 
His face still combating with tears and smiles 
The badges of his grief and patience 
That had not God  for some strong purpose  steeld 
The hearts of men  they must perforce have melted 
And barbarism itself have pitied him 
But heaven hath a hand in these events 
To whose high will we bound our calm contents 
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now 
Whose state and honour I for aye allow 

Here comes my son Aumerle 

Aumerle that was 
But that is lost for being Richards friend 
And  madam  you must call him Rutland now 
I am in parliament pledge for his truth 
And lasting fealty to the newmade king 


Welcome  my son  who are the violets now 
That strew the green lap of the new come spring 

Madam  I know not  nor I greatly care not 
God knows I had as lief be none as one 

Well  bear you well in this new spring of time 
Lest you be croppd before you come to prime 
What news from Oxford  hold those justs and triumphs 

For aught I know  my lord  they do 

You will be there  I know 

If God prevent it not  I purpose so 

What seal is that that hangs without thy bosom 
Yea  lookst thou pale  let me see the writing 

My lord  tis nothing 

No matter then  who sees it 
I will be satisfied  let me see the writing 

I do beseech your Grace to pardon me 
It is a matter of small consequence 
Which for some reasons I would not have seen 

Which for some reasons  sir  I mean to see 
I fear  I fear 

What should you fear 
Tis nothing but some bond hes enterd into 
For gay apparel gainst the triumph day 

Bound to himself  what doth he with a bond 
That he is bound to  Wife  thou art a fool 
Boy  let me see the writing 

I do beseech you  pardon me  I may not show it 

I will be satisfied  let me see it  I say 

Treason  foul treason  villain  traitor  slave 

What is the matter  my lord 

Ho  who is within there 


Saddle my horse 

God for his mercy  what treachery is here 

Why  what is it  my lord 

Give me my boots  I say  saddle my horse 
Now  by mine honour  by my life  my troth 
I will appeach the villain 


Whats the matter 

Peace  foolish woman 

I will not peace  What is the matter  Aumerle 

Good mother  be content  it is no more 
Than my poor life must answer 

Thy life answer 

Bring me my boots  I will unto the king 


Strike him  Aumerle  Poor boy  thou art amazd 


Hence  villain  never more come in my sight 


Give me my boots  I say 

Why  York  what wilt thou do 
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own 
Have we more sons  or are we like to have 
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time 
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age 
And rob me of a happy mothers name 
Is he not like thee  is he not thine own 

Thou fond  mad woman 
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy 
A dozen of them here have taen the sacrament 
And interchangeably set down their hands 
To kill the king at Oxford 

He shall be none 
Well keep him here  then  what is that to him 

Away  fond woman  were he twenty times 
My son  I would appeach him 

Hadst thou groand for him 
As I have done  thoudst be more pitiful 
But now I know thy mind  thou dost suspect 
That I have been disloyal to thy bed 
And that he is a bastard  not thy son 
Sweet York  sweet husband  be not of that mind 
He is as like thee as a man may be 
Not like to me  nor any of my kin 
And yet I love him 

Make way  unruly woman 


After  Aumerle  Mount thee upon his horse 
Spur post  and get before him to the king 
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee 
Ill not be long behind  though I be old 
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York 
And never will I rise up from the ground 
Till Bolingbroke have pardond thee  Away  be gone 


Can no man tell of my unthrifty son 
Tis full three months since I did see him last 
If any plague hang over us  tis he 
I would to God  my lords  he might be found 
Inquire at London  mongst the taverns there 
For there  they say  he daily doth frequent 
With unrestrained loose companions 
Even such  they say  as stand in narrow lanes 
And beat our watch and rob our passengers 
While he  young wanton and effeminate boy 
Takes on the point of honour to support 
So dissolute a crew 

My lord  some two days since I saw the prince 
And told him of these triumphs held at Oxford 

And what said the gallant 

His answer was  he would unto the stews 
And from the commonst creature pluck a glove 
And wear it as a favour  and with that 
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger 

As dissolute as desperate  yet  through both 
I see some sparkles of a better hope 
Which elder days may happily bring forth 
But who comes here 


Where is the king 

What means 
Our cousin  that he stares and looks so wildly 

God save your Grace  I do beseech your majesty 
To have some conference with your Grace alone 

Withdraw yourselves  and leave us here alone 

What is the matter with our cousin now 

For ever may my knees grow to the earth 
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth 
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak 

Intended or committed was this fault 
If on the first  how heinous eer it be 
To win thy afterlove I pardon thee 

Then give me leave that I may turn the key 
That no man enter till my tale be done 

Have thy desire 


My liege  beware  look to thyself 
Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there 

Villain  Ill make thee safe 

Stay thy revengeful hand  thou hast no cause to fear 

Open the door  secure  foolhardy king 
Shall I for love speak treason to thy face 
Open the door  or I will break it open 

What is the matter  uncle  speak 
Recover breath  tell us how near is danger 
That we may arm us to encounter it 

Peruse this writing here  and thou shalt know 
The treason that my haste forbids me show 

Remember  as thou readst  thy promise passd 
I do repent me  read not my name there 
My heart is not confederate with my hand 

Twas  villain  ere thy hand did set it down 
I tore it from the traitors bosom  king 
Fear  and not love  begets his penitence 
Forget to pity him  lest thy pity prove 
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart 

O heinous  strong  and bold conspiracy 
O loyal father of a treacherous son 
Thou sheer  immaculate  and silver fountain 
From whence this stream through muddy passages 
Hath held his current and defild himself 
Thy overflow of good converts to bad 
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse 
This deadly blot in thy digressing son 

So shall my virtue be his vices bawd 
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame 
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold 
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies 
Or my shamd life in his dishonour lies 
Thou killst me in his life  giving him breath 
The traitor lives  the true mans put to death 

What ho  my liege  for Gods sake let me in 

What shrillvoicd suppliant makes this eager cry 

A woman  and thine aunt  great king  tis I 
Speak with me  pity me  open the door 
A beggar begs  that never beggd before 

Our scene is alterd from a serious thing 
And now changd to The Beggar and the King  
My dangerous cousin  let your mother in 
I know shes come to pray for your foul sin 


If thou do pardon  whosoever pray 
More sins  for this forgiveness  prosper may 
This festerd joint cut off  the rest rests sound 
This  let alone  will all the rest confound 


O king  believe not this hardhearted man 
Love  loving not itself  none other can 

Thou frantic woman  what dost thou make here 
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear 

Sweet York  bepatient 

Hear me  gentle liege 

Rise up  good aunt 

Not yet  I thee beseech 
For ever will I walk upon my knees 
And never see day that the happy sees 
Till thou give joy  until thou bid me joy 
By pardoning Rutland  my transgressing boy 

Unto my mothers prayers I bend my knee 


Against them both my true joints bended be 

Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace 

Pleads he in earnest  look upon his face 
His eyes do drop no tears  his prayers are in jest 
His words come from his mouth  ours from our breast 
He prays but faintly and would be denied 
We pray with heart and soul and all beside 
His weary joints would gladly rise  I know 
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow 
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy 
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity 
Our prayers do outpray his  then let them have 
That mercy which true prayer ought to have 

Good aunt  stand up 

Nay  do not say stand up  
But pardon first  and afterwards stand up  
An if I were thy nurse  thy tongue to teach 
Pardon should be the first word of thy speech 
I never longd to hear a word till now 
Say pardon  king  let pity teach thee how 
The word is short  but not so short as sweet 
No word like pardon  for kings mouths so meet 

Speak it in French  king  say  pardonnez moy  

Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy 
Ah  my sour husband  my hardhearted lord 
That settst the word itself against the word 
Speak pardon as tis current in our land 
The chopping French we do not understand 
Thine eye begins to speak  set thy tongue there 
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear 
That hearing how our plants and prayers do pierce 
Pity may move thee pardon to rehearse 

Good aunt  stand up 

I do not sue to stand 
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand 

I pardon him  as God shall pardon me 

O happy vantage of a kneeling knee 
Yet am I sick for fear  speak it again 
Twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain 
But makes one pardon strong 

With all my heart 
I pardon him 

A god on earth thou art 

But for our trusty brotherinlaw and the abbot 
With all the rest of that consorted crew 
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels 
Good uncle  help to order several powers 
To Oxford  or whereer these traitors are 
They shall not live within this world  I swear 
But I will have them  if I once know where 
Uncle  farewell  and cousin too  adieu 
Your mother well hath prayd  and prove you true 

Come  my old son  I pray God make thee new 


Didst thou not mark the king  what words he spake 
Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear  
Was it not so 

Those were his very words 

Have I no friend  quoth he  he spake it twice 
And urgd it twice together  did he not 

He did 

And speaking it  he wistly looked on me 
As who should say  I would thou wert the man 
That would divorce this terror from my heart  
Meaning the king at Pomfret  Come  lets go 
I am the kings friend  and will rid his foe 


I have been studying how I may compare 
This prison where I live unto the world 
And for because the world is populous 
And here is not a creature but myself 
I cannot do it  yet Ill hammer it out 
My brain Ill prove the female to my soul 
My soul the father  and these two beget 
A generation of stillbreeding thoughts 
And these same thoughts people this little world 
In humours like the people of this world 
For no thought is contented  The better sort 
As thoughts of things divine  are intermixd 
With scruples  and do set the word itself 
Against the word 
As thus  Come  little ones  and then again 
It is as hard to come as for a camel 
To thread the postern of a needles eye  
Thoughts tending to ambition  they do plot 
Unlikely wonders  how these vain weak nails 
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs 
Of this hard world  my ragged prison walls 
And  for they cannot  die in their own pride 
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves 
That they are not the first of fortunes slaves 
Nor shall not be the last  like silly beggars 
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame 
That many have and others must sit there 
And in this thought they find a kind of ease 
Bearing their own misfortune on the back 
Of such as have before endurd the like 
Thus play I in one person many people 
And none contented  sometimes am I king 
Then treason makes me wish myself a beggar 
And so I am  then crushing penury 
Persuades me I was better when a king 
Then am I kingd again  and by and by 
Think that I am unkingd by Bolingbroke 
And straight am nothing  but whateer I be 
Nor I nor any man that but man is 
With nothing shall be pleasd  till he be easd 
With being nothing  Music do I hear 

Ha  ha  keep time  How sour sweet music is 
When time is broke and no proportion kept 
So is it in the music of mens lives 
And here have I the daintiness of ear 
To check time broke in a disorderd string 
But for the concord of my state and time 
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke 
I wasted time  and now doth time waste me 
For now hath time made me his numbering clock 
My thoughts are minutes  and with sighs they jar 
Their watches on unto mine eyes  the outward watch 
Whereto my finger  like a dials point 
Is pointing still  in cleansing them from tears 
Now sir  the sound that tells what hour it is 
Are clamorous groans  that strike upon my heart 
Which is the bell  so sighs and tears and groans 
Show minutes  times  and hours  but my time 
Runs posting on in Bolingbrokes proud joy 
While I stand fooling here  his Jack o the clock 
This music mads me  let it sound no more 
For though it have holp madmen to their wits 
In me it seems it will make wise men mad 
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me 
For tis a sign of love  and love to Richard 
Is a strange brooch in this allhating world 


Hail  royal prince 

Thanks  noble peer 
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear 
What art thou  and how comest thou hither  man 
Where no man never comes but that sad dog 
That brings me food to make misfortune live 

I was a poor groom of thy stable  king 
When thou wert king  who  travelling towards York 
With much ado at length have gotten leave 
To look upon my sometimes royal masters face 
O  how it yearnd my heart when I beheld 
In London streets  that coronation day 
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary 
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid 
That horse that I so carefully have dressd 

Rode he on Barbary  Tell me  gentle friend 
How went he under him 

So proudly as if he disdaind the ground 

So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back 
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand 
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him 
Would he not stumble  Would he not fall down 
Since pride must have a fall and break the neck 
Of that proud man that did usurp his back 
Forgiveness  horse  why do I rail on thee 
Since thou  created to be awd by man 
Wast born to bear  I was not made a horse 
And yet I bear a burden like an ass 
Spurgalld and tird by jauncing Bolingbroke 


Fellow  give place  here is no longer stay 

If thou love me  tis time thou wert away 

What my tongue dares not  that my heart shall say 


My lord  willt please you to fall to 

Taste of it first  as thou art wont to do 

My lord  I dare not  Sir Pierce of Exton  who lately came from the king  commands the contrary 

The devil take Henry of Lancaster  and thee 
Patience is stale  and I am weary of it 


Help  help  help 


How now  what means death in this rude assault 
Villain  thine own hand yields thy deaths instrument 

Go thou and fill another room in hell 

That hand shall burn in neverquenching fire 
That staggers thus my person  Exton  thy fierce hand 
Hath with the kings blood staind the kings own land 
Mount  mount  my soul  thy seat is up on high 
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward  here to die 


As full of valour as of royal blood 
Both have I spilt  O  would the deed were good 
For now the devil  that told me I did well 
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell 
This dead king to the living king Ill bear 
Take hence the rest and give them burial here 


Kind uncle York  the latest news we hear 
Is that the rebels have consumd with fire 
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire 
But whether they be taen or slain we hear not 

Welcome  my lord  What is the news 

First  to thy sacred state wish I all happiness 
The next news is  I have to London sent 
The heads of Salisbury  Spencer  Blunt  and Kent 
The manner of their taking may appear 
At large discoursed in this paper here 

We thank thee  gentle Percy  for thy pains 
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains 


My lord  I have from Oxford sent to London 
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely 
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors 
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow 

Thy pains  Fitzwater  shall not be forgot 
Right noble is thy merit  well I wot 


The grand conspirator  Abbot of Westminster 
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy 
Hath yielded up his body to the grave 
But here is Carlisle living  to abide 
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride 

Carlisle  this is your doom 
Choose out some secret place  some reverend room 
More than thou hast  and with it joy thy life 
So  as thou livest in peace  die free from strife 
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been 
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen 


Great king  within this coffin I present 
Thy buried fear  herein all breathless lies 
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies 
Richard of Bordeaux  by me hither brought 

Exton  I thank thee not  for thou hast wrought 
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand 
Upon my head and all this famous land 

From your own mouth  my lord  did I this deed 

They love not poison that do poison need 
Nor do I thee  though I did wish him dead 
I hate the murderer  love him murdered 
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour 
But neither my good word nor princely favour 
With Cain go wander through the shade of night 
And never show thy head by day nor light 
Lords  I protest  my soul is full of woe 
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow 
Come  mourn with me for that I do lament 
And put on sullen black incontinent 
Ill make a voyage to the Holy Land 
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand 
March sadly after  grace my mournings here 
In weeping after this untimely bier
