THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA

Cease to persuade  my loving Proteus 
Homekeeping youth have ever homely wits 
Weret not affection chains thy tender days 
To the sweet glances of thy honourd love 
I rather would entreat thy company 
To see the wonders of the world abroad 
Than  living dully sluggardizd at home 
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness 
But since thou lovst  love still  and thrive therein 
Even as I would when I to love begin 

Wilt thou be gone  Sweet Valentine  adieu 
Think on thy Proteus  when thou haply seest 
Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel 
Wish me partaker in thy happiness 
When thou dost meet good hap  and in thy danger 
If ever danger do environ thee 
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers 
For I will be thy beadsman  Valentine 

And on a lovebook pray for my success 

Upon some book I love Ill pray for thee 

Thats on some shallow story of deep love 
How young Leander crossd the Hellespont 

Thats a deep story of a deeper love 
For he was more than over shoes in love 

Tis true  for you are over boots in love 
And yet you never swum the Hellespont 

Over the boots  nay  give me not the boots 

No  I will not  for it boots thee not 

What 

To be in love  where scorn is bought with groans 
Coy looks with heartsore sighs  one fading moments mirth 
With twenty watchful  weary  tedious nights 
If haply won  perhaps a hapless gain 
If lost  why then a grievous labour won 
However  but a folly bought with wit 
Or else a wit by folly vanquished 

So  by your circumstance  you call me fool 

So  by your circumstance  I fear youll prove 

Tis love you cavil at  I am not Love 

Love is your master  for he masters you 
And he that is so yoked by a fool 
Methinks  should not be chronicled for wise 

Yet writers say  as in the sweetest bud 
The eating canker dwells  so eating love 
Inhabits in the finest wits of all 

And writers say  as the most forward bud 
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow 
Even so by love the young and tender wit 
Is turned to folly  blasting in the bud 
Losing his verdure even in the prime 
And all the fair effects of future hopes 
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee 
That art a votary to fond desire 
Once more adieu  my father at the road 
Expects my coming  there to see me shippd 

And thither will I bring thee  Valentine 

Sweet Proteus  no  now let us take our leave 
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters 
Of thy success in love  and what news else 
Betideth here in absence of thy friend 
And I likewise will visit thee with mine 

All happiness bechance to thee in Milan 

As much to you at home  and so  farewell 


He after honour hunts  I after love 
He leaves his friends to dignify them more 
I leave myself  my friends and all  for love 
Thou  Julia  thou hast metamorphosd me 
Made me neglect my studies  lose my time 
War with good counsel  set the world at nought 
Made wit with musing weak  heart sick with thought 


Sir Proteus  save you  Saw you my master 

But now he parted hence  to embark for Milan 

Twenty to one  then  he is shippd already 
And I have playd the sheep  in losing him 

Indeed  a sheep doth very often stray 
An if the shepherd be a while away 

You conclude that my master is a shepherd  then  and I a sheep 

I do 

Why then my horns are his horns  whether I wake or sleep 

A silly answer  and fitting well a sheep 

This proves me still a sheep 

True  and thy master a shepherd 

Nay  that I can deny by a circumstance 

It shall go hard but Ill prove it by another 

The shepherd seeks the sheep  and not the sheep the shepherd  but I seek my master  and my master seeks not me  therefore I am no sheep 

The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd  the shepherd for food follows not the sheep  thou for wages followest thy master  thy master for wages follows not thee  therefore thou art a sheep 

Such another proof will make me cry baa  

But  dost thou hear  gavest thou my letter to Julia 

Ay  sir  I  a lost mutton  gave your letter to her  a laced mutton  and she  a laced mutton  gave me  a lost mutton  nothing for my labour 

Heres too small a pasture for such store of muttons 

If the ground be overcharged  you were best stick her 

Nay  in that you are astray  twere best pound you 

Nay  sir  less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter 

You mistake  I mean the pound a pinfold 

From a pound to a pin  fold it over and over 
Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover 

But what said she 

Did she nod 

Ay 

Nod  ay  why  thats noddy 

You mistook  sir  I say she did nod  and you ask me if she did nod  and I say  Ay 

And that set together is noddy 

Now you have taken the pains to set it together  take it for your pains 

No  no  you shall have it for bearing the letter 

Well  I perceive I must be fain to bear with you 

Why  sir  how do you bear with me 

Marry  sir  the letter very orderly  having nothing but the word noddy for my pains 

Beshrew me  but you have a quick wit 

And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse 

Come  come  open the matter in brief  what said she 

Open your purse  that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered 

Well  sir  here is for your pains 

What said she 

Truly  sir  I think youll hardly win her 

Why  couldst thou perceive so much from her 

Sir  I could perceive nothing at all from her  no  not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter  And being so hard to me that brought your mind  I fear shell prove as hard to you in telling your mind  Give her no token but stones  for shes as hard as steel 

What  said she nothing 

No  not so much as Take this for thy pains  To testify your bounty  I thank you  you have testerned me  in requital whereof  henceforth carry your letters yourself  And so  sir  Ill commend you to my master 

Go  go  be gone  to save your ship from wrack 
Which cannot perish  having thee aboard 
Being destind to a drier death on shore 

I must go send some better messenger 
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines 
Receiving them from such a worthless post 


But say  Lucetta  now we are alone 
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love 

Ay  madam  so you stumble not unheedfully 

Of all the fair resort of gentlemen 
That every day with parle encounter me 
In thy opinion which is worthiest love 

Please you repeat their names  Ill show my mind 
According to my shallow simple skill 

What thinkst thou of the fair Sir Eglamour 

As of a knight wellspoken  neat and fine 
But  were I you  he never should be mine 

What thinkst thou of the rich Mercatio 

Well of his wealth  but of himself  so so 

What thinkst thou of the gentle Proteus 

Lord  Lord  to see what folly reigns in us 

How now  what means this passion at his name 

Pardon  dear madam  tis a passing shame 
That I  unworthy body as I am 
Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen 

Why not on Proteus  as of all the rest 

Then thus of many good I think him best 

Your reason 

I have no other but a womans reason 
I think him so because I think him so 

And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him 

Ay  if you thought your love not cast away 

Why  he  of all the rest hath never movd me 

Yet he of all the rest  I think  best loves ye 

His little speaking shows his love but small 

Fire thats closest kept burns most of all 

They do not love that do not show their love 

O  they love least that let men know their love 

I would I knew his mind 

Peruse this paper  madam 


To Julia  Say from whom 

That the contents will show 

Say  say  who gave it thee 

Sir Valentines page  and sent  I think  from Proteus 
He would have given it you  but I  being in the way 
Did in your name receive it  pardon the fault  I pray 

Now  by my modesty  a goodly broker 
Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines 
To whisper and conspire against my youth 
Now  trust me  tis an office of great worth 
And you an officer fit for the place 
There  take the paper  see it be returnd 
Or else return no more into my sight 

To plead for love deserves more fee than hate 

Will ye be gone 

That you may ruminate 


And yet I would I had oerlookd the letter 
It were a shame to call her back again 
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her 
What fool is she  that knows I am a maid 
And would not force the letter to my view 
Since maids  in modesty  say No to that 
Which they would have the profferer construe Ay  
Fie  fie  how wayward is this foolish love 
That  like a testy babe  will scratch the nurse 
And presently all humbled kiss the rod 
How churlishly I child Lucetta hence 
When willingly I would have had her here 
How angerly I taught my brow to frown 
When inward joy enforcd my heart to smile 
My penance is  to call Lucetta back 
And ask remission for my folly past 
What ho  Lucetta 


What would your ladyship 

Is it near dinnertime 

I would it were 
That you might kill your stomach on your meat 
And not upon your maid 

What ist that you took up so gingerly 

Nothing 

Why didst thou stoop  then 

To take a paper up 
That I let fall 

And is that paper nothing 

Nothing concerning me 

Then let it lie for those that it concerns 

Madam  it will not lie where it concerns 
Unless it have a false interpreter 

Some love of yours hath writ to you in rime 

That I might sing it  madam  to a tune 
Give me a note  your ladyship can set 

As little by such toys as may be possible 
Best sing it to the tune of Light o Love  

It is too heavy for so light a tune 

Heavy  belike it hath some burden  then 

Ay  and melodious were it  would you sing it 

And why not you 

I cannot reach so high 

Lets see your song 

How now  minion 

Keep tune there still  so you will sing it out 
And yet methinks  I do not like this tune 

You do not 

No  madam  it is too sharp 

You  minion  are too saucy 

Nay  now you are too flat 
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant 
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song 

The mean is drownd with your unruly bass 

Indeed  I bid the base for Proteus 

This babble shall not henceforth trouble me 
Here is a coil with protestation 

Go  get you gone  and let the papers lie 
You would be fingering them  to anger me 

She makes it strange  but she would be best pleasd 
To be so angerd with another letter 


Nay  would I were so angerd with the same 
O hateful hands  to tear such loving words 
Injurious wasps  to feed on such sweet honey 
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings 
Ill kiss each several paper for amends 
Look  here is writ kind Julia  unkind Julia 
As in revenge of thy ingratitude 
I throw thy name against the bruising stones 
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain 
And here is writ lovewounded Proteus  
Poor wounded name  my bosom  as a bed 
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heald 
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss 
But twice or thrice was Proteus written down 
Be calm  good wind  blow not a word away 
Till I have found each letter in the letter 
Except mine own name  that some whirlwind bear 
Unto a ragged  fearful hanging rock 
And throw it thence into the raging sea 
Lo  here in one line is his name twice writ 
Poor forlorn Proteus  passionate Proteus 
To the sweet Julia that Ill tear away 
And yet I will not  sith so prettily 
He couples it to his complaining names 
Thus will I fold them one upon another 
Now kiss  embrace  contend  do what you will 


Madam 
Dinner is ready  and your father stays 

Well  let us go 

What  shall these papers he like telltales here 

If you respect them  best to take them up 

Nay  I was taken up for laying them down 
Yet here they shall not lie  for catching cold 

I see you have a months mind to them 

Ay  madam  you may say what sights you see 
I see things too  although you judge I wink 

Come  come  willt please you go 


Tell me  Panthino  what sad talk was that 
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister 

Twas of his nephew Proteus  your son 

Why  what of him 

He wonderd that your lordship 
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home 
While other men  of slender reputation 
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out 
Some to the wars  to try their fortune there 
Some to discover islands far away 
Some to the studious universities 
For any or for all these exercises 
He said that Proteus your son was meet 
And did request me to importune you 
To let him spend his time no more at home 
Which would be great impeachment to his age 
In having known to travel in his youth 

Nor needst thou much importune me to that 
Whereon this month I have been hammering 
I have considerd well his loss of time 
And how he cannot be a perfect man 
Not being tried and tutord in the world 
Experience is by industry achievd 
And perfected by the swift course of time 
Then tell me  whither were I best to send him 

I think your lordship is not ignorant 
How his companion  youthful Valentine 
Attends the emperor in his royal court 

I know it well 

Twere good  I think  your lordship sent him thither 
There shall be practise tilts and tournaments 
Hear sweet discourse  converse with noblemen 
And be in eye of every exercise 
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth 

I like thy counsel  well hast thou advisd 
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it 
The execution of it shall make known 
Even with the speediest expedition 
I will dispatch him to the emperors court 

Tomorrow  may it please you  Don Alphonso 
With other gentlemen of good esteem 
Are journeying to salute the emperor 
And to commend their service to his will 

Good company  with them shall Proteus go 
And in good time now will we break with him 


Sweet love  sweet lines  sweet life 
Here is her hand  the agent of her heart 
Here is her oath for love  her honours pawn 
O  that our fathers would applaud our loves 
To seal our happiness with their consents 
O heavenly Julia 

How now  what letter are you reading there 

Mayt please your lordship  tis a word or two 
Of commendations sent from Valentine 
Deliverd by a friend that came from him 

Lend me the letter  let me see what news 

There is no news  my lord  but that he writes 
How happily he lives  how well belovd 
And daily graced by the emperor 
Wishing me with him  partner of his fortune 

And how stand you affected to his wish 

As one relying on your lordships will 
And not depending on his friendly wish 

My will is something sorted with his wish 
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed 
For what I will  I will  and there an end 
I am resolvd that thou shalt spend some time 
With Valentinus in the emperors court 
What maintenance he from his friends receives 
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me 
Tomorrow be in readiness to go 
Excuse it not  for I am peremptory 

My lord  I cannot be so soon provided 
Please you  deliberate a day or two 

Look  what thou wantst shall be sent after thee 
No more of stay  tomorrow thou must go 
Come on  Panthino  you shall be employd 
To hasten on his expedition 


Thus have I shunnd the fire for fear of burning 
And drenchd me in the sea  where I am drownd 
I feard to show my father Julias letter 
Lest he should take exceptions to my love 
And with the vantage of mine own excuse 
Hath he excepted most against my love 
O  how this spring of love resembleth 
The uncertain glory of an April day 
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun 
And by and by a cloud takes all away 


Sir Proteus  your father calls for you 
He is in haste  therefore  I pray you  go 

Why  this it is  my heart accords thereto 
And yet a thousand times it answers  no  

Sir  your glove 


Not mine  my gloves are on 

Why  then this may be yours  for this is but one 

Ha  let me see  ay  give it me  its mine 
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine 
Ah Silvia  Silvia 

Madam Silvia  Madam Silvia 

How now  sirrah 

She is not within hearing  sir 

Why  sir  who bade you call her 

Your worship  sir  or else I mistook 

Well  youll still be too forward 

And yet I was last chidden for being too slow 

Go to  sir  Tell me  do you know Madam Silvia 

She that your worship loves 

Why  how know you that I am in love 

Marry  by these special marks  first  you have learned  like Sir Proteus  to wreathe your arms  like a malecontent  to relish a lovesong  like a robinredbreast  to walk alone  like one that had the pestilence  to sigh  like a schoolboy that had lost his A B C  to weep  like a young wench that had buried her grandam  to fast  like one that takes diet  to watch  like one that fears robbing  to speak puling  like a beggar at Hallowmas  You were wont  when you laughed  to crow like a cock  when you walked  to walk like one of the lions  when you fasted  it was presently after dinner  when you looked sadly  it was for want of money  and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress  that  when I look on you  I can hardly think you my master 

Are all these things perceived in me 

They are all perceived without ye 

Without me  they cannot 

Without you  nay  thats certain  for  without you were so simple  none else would  but you are so without these follies  that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal  that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady 

But tell me  dost thou know my lady Silvia 

She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper 

Hast thou observed that  even she  I mean 

Why  sir  I know her not 

Dost thou know her by my gazing on her  and yet knowest her not 

Is she not hardfavoured  sir 

Not so fair  boy  as wellfavoured 

Sir  I know that well enough 

What dost thou know 

That she is not so fair  as  of you  wellfavoured 

I mean that her beauty is exquisite  but her favour infinite 

Thats because the one is painted and the other out of all count 

How painted  and how out of count 

Marry  sir  so painted to make her fair  that no man counts of her beauty 

How esteemest thou me  I account of her beauty 

You never saw her since she was deformed 

How long hath she been deformed 

Ever since you loved her 

I have loved her ever since I saw her  and still I see her beautiful 

If you love her you cannot see her 

Why 

Because Love is blind  O  that you had mine eyes  or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered 

What should I see then 

Your own present folly and her passing deformity  for he  being in love  could not see to garter his hose  and you  being in love  cannot see to put on your hose 

Belike  boy  then  you are in love  for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes 

True  sir  I was in love with my bed  I thank you  you swinged me for my love  which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours 

In conclusion  I stand affected to her 

I would you were set  so your affection would cease 

Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves 

And have you 

I have 

Are they not lamely writ 

No  boy  but as well as I can do them 
Peace  here she comes 


O excellent motion  O exceeding puppet  now will he interpret to her 

Madam and mistress  a thousand good morrows 

O  give ye good even  heres a million of manners 

Sir Valentine and servant  to you two thousand 

He should give her interest  and she gives it him 

As you enjoind me  I have writ your letter 
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours 
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in 
But for my duty to your ladyship 


I thank you  gentle servant  Tis very clerkly done 

Now  trust me  madam  it came hardly off 
For  being ignorant to whom it goes 
I writ at random  very doubtfully 

Perchance you think too much of so much pains 

No  madam  so it stead you  I will write 
Please you command  a thousand times as much 
And yet 

A pretty period  Well  I guess the sequel 
And yet I will not name it  and yet I care not 
And yet take this again  and yet I thank you 
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more 

And yet you will  and yet another yet 

What means your ladyship  do you not like it 

Yes  yes  the lines are very quaintly writ 
But since unwillingly  take them again 
Nay  take them 


Madam  they are for you 

Ay  ay  you writ them  sir  at my request 
But I will none of them  they are for you 
I would have had them writ more movingly 

Please you  Ill write your ladyship another 

And when its writ  for my sake read it over 
And if it please you  so  if not  why  so 

If it please me  madam  what then 

Why  if it please you  take it for your labour 
And so  good morrow  servant 


O jest unseen  inscrutable  invisible 
As a nose on a mans face  or a weathercock on a steeple 
My master sues to her  and she hath taught her suitor 
He being her pupil  to become her tutor 
O excellent device  was there ever heard a better 
That my master  being scribe  to himself should write the letter 

How now  sir  what are you reasoning with yourself 

Nay  I was riming  tis you that have the reason 

To do what 

To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia 

To whom 

To yourself  Why  she wooes you by a figure 

What figure 

By a letter  I should say 

Why  she hath not writ to me 

What need she  when she hath made you write to yourself  Why  do you not perceive the jest 

No  believe me 

No believing you  indeed  sir  But did you perceive her earnest 

She gave me none  except an angry word 

Why  she hath given you a letter 

Thats the letter I writ to her friend 

And that letter hath she delivered  and there an end 

I would it were no worse 

Ill warrant you  tis as well 
For often have you writ to her  and she  in modesty 
Or else for want of idle time  could not again reply 
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover 
Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover  
All this I speak in print  for in print I found it 
Why muse you  sir  tis dinnertime 

I have dined 

Ay  but hearken  sir  though the chameleon Love can feed on the air  I am one that am nourished by my victuals and would fain have meat  O  be not like your mistress  be moved  be moved 


Have patience  gentle Julia 

I must  where is no remedy 

When possibly I can  I will return 

If you turn not  you will return the sooner 
Keep this remembrance for thy Julias sake 


Why  then  well make exchange  here  take you this 


And seal the bargain with a holy kiss 

Here is my hand for my true constancy 
And when that hour oerslips me in the day 
Wherein I sigh not  Julia  for thy sake 
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance 
Torment me for my loves forgetfulness 
My father stays my coming  answer not 
The tide is now  nay  not thy tide of tears 
That tide will stay me longer than I should 
Julia  farewell 

What  gone without a word 
Ay  so true love should do  it cannot speak 
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it 


Sir Proteus  you are stayd for 

Go  I come  I come 
Alas  this parting strikes poor lovers dumb 


Nay  twill be this hour ere I have done weeping  all the kind of the Launces have this very fault  I have received my proportion  like the prodigious son  and am going with Sir Proteus to the imperials court  I think Crab my dog be the sourestnatured dog that lives  my mother weeping  my father wailing  my sister crying  our maid howling  our cat wringing her hands  and all our house in a great perplexity  yet did not this cruelhearted cur shed one tear  He is a stone  a very pebble stone  and has no more pity in him than a dog  a Jew would have wept to have seen our parting  why  my grandam  having no eyes  look you  wept herself blind at my parting  Nay  Ill show you the manner of it  This shoe is my father  no  this left shoe is my father  no  no  this left shoe is my mother  nay  that cannot be so neither yes  it is so  it is so  it hath the worser sole  This shoe  with the hole in  is my mother  and this my father  A vengeance ont  there tis  now  sir  this staff is my sister  for  look you  she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand  this hat is Nan  our maid  I am the dog  no  the dog is himself  and I am the dog O  the dog is me  and I am myself  ay  so  so  Now come I to my father  Father  your blessing  now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping  now should I kiss my father  well  he weeps on  Now come I to my mother O  that she could speak now like a wood woman  Well  I kiss her  why  there tis  heres my mothers breath up and down  Now come I to my sister  mark the moan she makes  Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word  but see how I lay the dust with my tears 


Launce  away  away  aboard  thy master is shipped  and thou art to post after with oars  Whats the matter  why weepest thou  man  Away  ass  youll lose the tide if you tarry any longer 

It is no matter if the tied were lost  for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied 

Whats the unkindest tide 

Why  he thats tied here  Crab  my dog 

Tut  man  I mean thoult lose the flood  and  in losing the flood  lose thy voyage  and  in losing thy voyage  lose thy master  and  in losing thy master  lose thy service  and  in losing thy service Why dost thou stop my mouth 

For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue 

Where should I lose my tongue 

In thy tale 

In thy tail 

Lose the tide  and the voyage  and the master  and the service  and the tied  Why  man  if the river were dry  I am able to fill it with my tears  if the wind were down  I could drive the boat with my sighs 

Come  come away  man  I was sent to call thee 

Sir  call me what thou darest 

Wilt thou go 

Well  I will go 


Servant 

Mistress 

Master  Sir Thurio frowns on you 

Ay  boy  its for love 

Not of you 

Of my mistress  then 

Twere good you knockd him 

Servant  you are sad 

Indeed  madam  I seem so 

Seem you that you are not 

Haply I do 

So do counterfeits 

So do you 

What seem I that I am not 

Wise 

What instance of the contrary 

Your folly 

And how quote you my folly 

I quote it in your jerkin 

My jerkin is a doublet 

Well  then  Ill double your folly 

How 

What  angry  Sir Thurio  do you change colour 

Give him leave  madam  he is a kind of chameleon 

That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air 

You have said  sir 

Ay  sir  and done too  for this time 

I know it well  sir  you always end ere you begin 

A fine volley of words  gentlemen  and quickly shot off 

Tis indeed  madam  we thank the giver 

Who is that  servant 

Yourself  sweet lady  for you gave the fire  Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyships looks  and spends what he borrows kindly in your company 

Sir  if you spend word for word with me  I shall make your wit bankrupt 

I know it well  sir  you have an exchequer of words  and  I think  no other treasure to give your followers  for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words 

No more  gentlemen  no more  Here comes my father 


Now  daughter Silvia  you are hard beset 
Sir Valentine  your fathers in good health 
What say you to a letter from your friends 
Of much good news 

My lord  I will be thankful 
To any happy messenger from thence 

Know ye Don Antonio  your countryman 

Ay  my good lord  I know the gentleman 
To be of worth and worthy estimation 
And not without desert so well reputed 

Hath he not a son 

Ay  my good lord  a son that well deserves 
The honour and regard of such a father 

You know him well 

I know him as myself  for from our infancy 
We have conversd and spent our hours together 
And though myself have been an idle truant 
Omitting the sweet benefit of time 
To clothe mine age with angellike perfection 
Yet hath Sir Proteus for thats his name 
Made use and fair advantage of his days 
His years but young  but his experience old 
His head unmellowd  but his judgment ripe 
And  in a word for far behind his worth 
Come all the praises that I now bestow 
He is complete in feature and in mind 
With all good grace to grace a gentleman 

Beshrew me  sir  but if he make this good 
He is as worthy for an empress love 
As meet to be an emperors counsellor 
Well  sir  this gentleman is come to me 
With commendation from great potentates 
And here he means to spend his time awhile 
I think  tis no unwelcome news to you 

Should I have wishd a thing  it had been he 

Welcome him then according to his worth 
Silvia  I speak to you  and you  Sir Thurio 
For Valentine  I need not cite him to it 
Ill send him hither to you presently 


This is the gentleman I told your ladyship 
Had come along with me  but that his mistress 
Did hold his eyes lockd in her crystal looks 

Belike that now she hath enfranchisd them 
Upon some other pawn for fealty 

Nay  sure  I think she holds them prisoners still 

Nay  then he should be blind  and  being blind 
How could he see his way to seek out you 

Why  lady  Love hath twenty pairs of eyes 

They say that Love hath not an eye at all 

To see such lovers  Thurio  as yourself 
Upon a homely object Love can wink 

Have done  have done  Here comes the gentleman 


Welcome  dear Proteus  Mistress  I beseech you 
Confirm his welcome with some special favour 

His worth is warrant for his welcome hither 
If this be he you oft have wishd to hear from 

Mistress  it is  sweet lady  entertain him 
To be my fellowservant to your ladyship 

Too low a mistress for so high a servant 

Not so  sweet lady  but too mean a servant 
To have a look of such a worthy mistress 

Leave off discourse of disability 
Sweet lady  entertain him for your servant 

My duty will I boast of  nothing else 

And duty never yet did want his meed 
Servant  you are welcome to a worthless mistress 

Ill die on him that says so but yourself 

That you are welcome 

That you are worthless 


Madam  my lord your father would speak with you 

I wait upon his pleasure 

Come  Sir Thurio 
Go with me  Once more  new servant  welcome 
Ill leave you to confer of homeaffairs 
When you have done  we look to hear from you 

Well both attend upon your ladyship 


Now  tell me  how do all from whence you came 

Your friends are well and have them much commended 

And how do yours 

I left them all in health 

How does your lady and how thrives your love 

My tales of love were wont to weary you 
I know you joy not in a lovediscourse 

Ay  Proteus  but that life is alterd now 
I have done penance for contemning love 
Whose high imperious thoughts have punishd me 
With bitter fasts  with penitential groans 
With nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs 
For  in revenge of my contempt of love 
Love hath chasd sleep from my enthralled eyes 
And made them watchers of mine own hearts sorrow 
O  gentle Proteus  Loves a mighty lord 
And hath so humbled me as I confess 
There is no woe to his correction 
Nor to his service no such joy on earth 
Now no discourse  except it be of love 
Now can I break my fast  dine  sup and sleep 
Upon the very naked name of love 

Enough  I read your fortune in your eye 
Was this the idol that you worship so 

Even she  and is she not a heavenly saint 

No  but she is an earthly paragon 

Call her divine 

I will not flatter her 

O  flatter me  for love delights in praises 

When I was sick you gave me bitter pills 
And I must minister the like to you 

Then speak the truth by her  if not divine 
Yet let her be a principality 
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth 

Except my mistress 

Sweet  except not any 
Except thou wilt except against my love 

Have I not reason to prefer mine own 

And I will help thee to prefer her too 
She shall be dignified with this high honour 
To bear my ladys train  lest the base earth 
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss 
And  of so great a favour growing proud 
Disdain to root the summerswelling flower 
And make rough winter everlastingly 

Why  Valentine  what braggardism is this 

Pardon me  Proteus  all I can is nothing 
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing 
She is alone 

Then  let her alone 

Not for the world  why  man  she is mine own 
And I as rich in having such a jewel 
As twenty seas  if all their sand were pearl 
The water nectar  and the rocks pure gold 
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee 
Because thou seest me dote upon my love 
My foolish rival  that her father likes 
Only for his possessions are so huge 
Is gone with her along  and I must after 
For love  thou knowst  is full of jealousy 

But she loves you 

Ay  and we are betrothd  nay  more  our marriagehour 
With all the cunning manner of our flight 
Determind of  how I must climb her window 
The ladder made of cords  and all the means 
Plotted and greed on for my happiness 
Good Proteus  go with me to my chamber 
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel 

Go on before  I shall inquire you forth 
I must unto the road  to disembark 
Some necessaries that I needs must use 
And then Ill presently attend you 

Will you make haste 

I will 

Even as one heat another heat expels 
Or as one nail by strength drives out another 
So the remembrance of my former love 
Is by a newer object quite forgotten 
Is it mine eye  or Valentinus praise 
Her true perfection  or my false transgression 
That makes me reasonless to reason thus 
Shes fair  and so is Julia that I love 
That I did love  for now my love is thawd 
Which  like a waxen image gainst a fire 
Bears no impression of the thing it was 
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold 
And that I love him not as I was wont 
O  but I love his lady tootoo much 
And thats the reason I love him so little 
How shall I dote on her with more advice 
That thus without advice begin to love her 
Tis but her picture I have yet beheld 
And that hath dazzled my reasons light 
But when I look on her perfections 
There is no reason but I shall be blind 
If I can check my erring love  I will 
If not  to compass her Ill use my skill 


Launce  by mine honesty  welcome to Milan 

Forswear not thyself  sweet youth  for I am not welcome  I reckon this always that a man is never undone till he be hanged  nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say  Welcome  

Come on  you madcap  Ill to the alehouse with you presently  where  for one shot of five pence  thou shalt have five thousand welcomes  But  sirrah  how did thy master part with Madam Julia 

Marry  after they closed in earnest  they parted very fairly in jest 

But shall she marry him 

No 

How then  Shall he marry her 

No  neither 

What  are they broken 

No  they are both as whole as a fish 

Why then  how stands the matter with them 

Marry  thus  when it stands well with him  it stands well with her 

What an ass art thou  I understand thee not 

What a block art thou  that thou canst not  My staff understands me 

What thou sayest 

Ay  and what I do too  look thee  Ill but lean  and my staff understands me 

It stands under thee  indeed 

Why  standunder and understand is all one 

But tell me true  willt be a match 

Ask my dog  if he say ay  it will  if he say no  it will  if he shake his tail and say nothing  it will 

The conclusion is  then  that it will 

Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable 

Tis well that I get it so  But  Launce  how sayest thou  that my master is become a notable lover 

I never knew him otherwise 

Than how 

A notable lubber  as thou reportest him to be 

Why  thou whoreson ass  thou mistakest me 

Why  fool  I meant not thee  I meant thy master 

I tell thee  my master is become a hot lover 

Why  I tell thee  I care not though he burn himself in love  If thou wilt go with me to the alehouse so  if not  thou art a Hebrew  a Jew  and not worth the name of a Christian 

Why 

Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian  Wilt thou go 

At thy service 


To leave my Julia  shall I be forsworn 
To love fair Silvia  shall I be forsworn 
To wrong my friend  I shall be much forsworn 
And even that power which gave me first my oath 
Provokes me to this threefold perjury 
Love bade me swear  and Love bids me forswear 
O sweetsuggesting Love  if thou hast sinnd 
Teach me  thy tempted subject  to excuse it 
At first I did adore a twinkling star 
But now I worship a celestial sun 
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken 
And he wants wit that wants resolved will 
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better 
Fie  fie  unreverend tongue  to call her bad 
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferrd 
With twenty thousand soulconfirming oaths 
I cannot leave to love  and yet I do 
But there I leave to love where I should love 
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose 
If I keep them  I needs must lose myself 
If I lose them  thus find I by their loss 
For Valentine  myself  for Julia  Silvia 
I to myself am dearer than a friend 
For love is still most precious in itself 
And Silvia witness heaven that made her fair 
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope 
I will forget that Julia is alive 
Remembering that my love to her is dead 
And Valentine Ill hold an enemy 
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend 
I cannot now prove constant to myself 
Without some treachery usd to Valentine 
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder 
To climb celestial Silvias chamberwindow 
Myself in counsel  his competitor 
Now presently  Ill give her father notice 
Of their disguising and pretended flight 
Who  all enragd  will banish Valentine 
For Thurio  he intends  shall wed his daughter 
But  Valentine being gone  Ill quickly cross 
By some sly trick blunt Thurios dull proceeding 
Love  lend me wings to make my purpose swift 
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift 


Counsel  Lucetta  gentle girl  assist me 
And een in kind love I do conjure thee 
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts 
Are visibly characterd and engravd 
To lesson me and tell me some good mean 
How  with my honour  I may undertake 
A journey to my loving Proteus 

Alas  the way is wearisome and long 

A truedevoted pilgrim is not weary 
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps 
Much less shall she that hath Loves wings to fly 
And when the flight is made to one so dear 
Of such divine perfection  as Sir Proteus 

Better forbear till Proteus make return 

O  knowst thou not his looks are my souls food 
Pity the dearth that I have pined in 
By longing for that food so long a time 
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love 
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow 
As seek to quench the fire of love with words 

I do not seek to quench your loves hot fire 
But qualify the fires extreme rage 
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason 

The more thou dammst it up  the more it burns 
The current that with gentle murmur glides 
Thou knowst  being stoppd  impatiently doth rage 
But when his fair course is not hindered 
He makes sweet music with th enamelld stones 
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge 
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage 
And so by many winding nooks he strays 
With willing sport  to the wild ocean 
Then let me go and hinder not my course 
Ill be as patient as a gentle stream 
And make a pastime of each weary step 
Till the last step have brought me to my love 
And there Ill rest  as after much turmoil 
A blessed soul doth in Elysium 

But in what habit will you go along 

Not like a woman  for I would prevent 
The loose encounters of lascivious men 
Gentle Lucetta  fit me with such weeds 
As may beseem some wellreputed page 

Why  then  your ladyship must cut your hair 

No  girl  Ill knit it up in silken strings 
With twenty oddconceited truelove knots 
To be fantastic may become a youth 
Of greater time than I shall show to be 

What fashion  madam  shall I make your breeches 

That fits as well as Tell me  good my lord 
What compass will you wear your farthingale  
Why  even what fashion thou best likst  Lucetta 

You must needs have them with a codpiece  madam 

Out  out  Lucetta  that will be illfavourd 

A round hose  madam  nows not worth a pin 
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on 

Lucetta  as thou lovst me  let me have 
What thou thinkst meet and is most mannerly 
But tell me  wench  how will the world repute me 
For undertaking so unstaid a journey 
I fear me  it will make me scandalizd 

If you think so  then stay at home and go not 

Nay  that I will not 

Then never dream on infamy  but go 
If Proteus like your journey when you come 
No matter whos displeasd when you are gone 
I fear me  he will scarce be pleasd withal 

That is the least  Lucetta  of my fear 
A thousand oaths  an ocean of his tears 
And instances of infinite of love 
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus 

All these are servants to deceitful men 

Base men  that use them to so base effect 
But truer stars did govern Proteus birth 
His words are bonds  his oaths are oracles 
His love sincere  his thoughts immaculate 
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart 
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth 

Pray heaven he prove so when you come to him 

Now  as thou lovst me  do him not that wrong 
To bear a hard opinion of his truth 
Only deserve my love by loving him 
And presently go with me to my chamber 
To take a note of what I stand in need of 
To furnish me upon my longing journey 
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose 
My goods  my lands  my reputation 
Only  in lieu thereof  dispatch me hence 
Come  answer not  but to it presently 
I am impatient of my tarriance 

Sir Thurio  give us leave  I pray  awhile 
We have some secrets to confer about 

Now tell me  Proteus  whats your will with me 

My gracious lord  that which I would discover 
The law of friendship bids me to conceal 
But when I call to mind your gracious favours 
Done to me  undeserving as I am 
My duty pricks me on to utter that 
Which else no worldly good should draw from me 
Know  worthy prince  Sir Valentine  my friend 
This night intends to steal away your daughter 
Myself am one made privy to the plot 
I know you have determind to bestow her 
On Thurio  whom your gentle daughter hates 
And should she thus be stoln away from you 
It would be much vexation to your age 
Thus  for my dutys sake  I rather chose 
To cross my friend in his intended drift 
Than  by concealing it  heap on your head 
A pack of sorrows which would press you down 
Being unprevented  to your timeless grave 

Proteus  I thank thee for thine honest care 
Which to requite  command me while I live 
This love of theirs myself have often seen 
Haply  when they have judgd me fast asleep 
And oftentimes have purposd to forbid 
Sir Valentine her company and my court 
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err 
And so unworthily disgrace the man 
A rashness that I ever yet have shunnd 
I gave him gentle looks  thereby to find 
That which thyself hast now disclosd to me 
And  that thou mayst perceive my fear of this 
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested 
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower 
The key whereof myself have ever kept 
And thence she cannot be conveyd away 

Know  noble lord  they have devisd a mean 
How he her chamberwindow will ascend 
And with a corded ladder fetch her down 
For which the youthful lover now is gone 
And this way comes he with it presently 
Where  if it please you  you may intercept him 
But  good my lord  do it so cunningly 
That my discovery be not aimed at 
For love of you  not hate unto my friend 
Hath made me publisher of this pretence 

Upon mine honour  he shall never know 
That I had any light from thee of this 

Adieu  my lord  Sir Valentine is coming 

Sir Valentine  whither away so fast 

Please it your Grace  there is a messenger 
That stays to bear my letters to my friends 
And I am going to deliver them 

Be they of much import 

The tenour of them doth but signify 
My health and happy being at your court 

Nay then  no matter  stay with me awhile 
I am to break with thee of some affairs 
That touch me near  wherein thou must be secret 
Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought 
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter 

I know it well  my lord  and sure  the match 
Were rich and honourable  besides  the gentleman 
Is full of virtue  bounty  worth  and qualities 
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter 
Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him 

No  trust me  she is peevish  sullen  froward 
Proud  disobedient  stubborn  lacking duty 
Neither regarding that she is my child 
Nor fearing me as if I were her father 
And  may I say to thee this pride of hers 
Upon advice  hath drawn my love from her 
And  where I thought the remnant of mine age 
Should have been cherishd by her childlike duty 
I now am full resolvd to take a wife 
And turn her out to who will take her in 
Then let her beauty be her weddingdower 
For me and my possessions she esteems not 

What would your Grace have me to do in this 

There is a lady of Verona here 
Whom I affect  but she is nice and coy 
And nought esteems my aged eloquence 
Now therefore  would I have thee to my tutor 
For long agone I have forgot to court 
Besides  the fashion of the time is changd 
How and which way I may bestow myself 
To be regarded in her sunbright eye 

Win her with gifts  if she respect not words 
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind 
More than quick words do move a womans mind 

But she did scorn a present that I sent her 

A woman sometime scorns what best contents her 
Send her another  never give her oer 
For scorn at first makes afterlove the more 
If she do frown  tis not in hate of you 
But rather to beget more love in you 
If she do chide  tis not to have you gone 
For why the fools are mad if left alone 
Take no repulse  whatever she doth say 
For  get you gone  she doth not mean  away  
Flatter and praise  commend  extol their graces 
Though neer so black  say they have angels faces 
That man that hath a tongue  I say  is no man 
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman 

But she I mean is promisd by her friends 
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth 
And kept severely from resort of men 
That no man hath access by day to her 

Why then  I would resort to her by night 

Ay  but the doors be lockd and keys kept safe 
That no man hath recourse to her by night 

What lets but one may enter at her window 

Her chamber is aloft  far from the ground 
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it 
Without apparent hazard of his life 

Why then  a ladder quaintly made of cords 
To cast up  with a pair of anchoring hooks 
Would serve to scale another Heros tower 
So bold Leander would adventure it 

Now  as thou art a gentleman of blood 
Advise me where I may have such a ladder 

When would you use it  pray  sir  tell me that 

This very night  for Love is like a child 
That longs for every thing that he can come by 

By seven oclock Ill get you such a ladder 

But hark thee  I will go to her alone 
How shall I best convey the ladder thither 

It will be light  my lord  that you may bear it 
Under a cloak that is of any length 

A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn 

Ay  my good lord 

Then let me see thy cloak 
Ill get me one of such another length 

Why  any cloak will serve the turn  my lord 

How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak 
I pray thee  let me feel thy cloak upon me 

What letter is this same  Whats here To Silvia 
And here an engine fit for my proceeding 
Ill be so bold to break the seal for once 

My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly 
And slaves they are to me that send them flying 
O  could their master come and go as lightly 
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying 
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them 
While I  their king  that thither them importune 
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blessd them 
Because myself do want my servants fortune 
I curse myself  for they are sent by me 
That they should harbour where their lord would be 

Whats here 

Silvia  this night I will enfranchise thee 

Tis so  and heres the ladder for the purpose 
Why  Phaethon for thou art Merops son 
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car 
And with thy daring folly burn the world 
Wilt thou reach stars  because they shine on thee 
Go  basc intruder  overweening slave 
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates 
And think my patience  more than thy desert 
Is privilege for thy departure hence 
Thank me for this more than for all the favours 
Which all too much I have bestowd on thee 
But if thou linger in my territories 
Longer than swiftest expedition 
Will give thee time to leave our royal court 
By heaven  my wrath shall far exceed the love 
I ever borc my daughter or thyself 
Be gone  I will not hear thy vain excuse 
But  as thou lovst thy life  make speed from hence 


And why not death rather than living torment 
To die is to be banishd from myself 
And Silvia is myself  banishd from her 
Is self from self a deadly banishment 
What light is light  if Silvia be not seen 
What joy is joy  if Silvia be not by 
Unless it be to think that she is by 
And feed upon the shadow of perfection 
Except I be by Silvia in the night 
There is no music in the nightingale 
Unless I look on Silvia in the day 
There is no day for me to look upon 
She is my essence  and I leave to be 
If I be not by her fair influence 
Fosterd  illumind  cherishd  kept alive 
I fly not death  to fly his deadly doom 
Tarry I here  I but attend on death 
But  fly I hence  I fly away from life 


Run  boy  run  run  and seek him out 

Soho  soho 

What seest thou 

Him we go to find  theres not a hair ons head but tis a Valentine 

Valentine 

No 

Who then  his spirit 

Neither 

What then 

Nothing 

Can nothing speak  Master  shall I strike 

Who wouldst thou strike 

Nothing 

Villain  forbear 

Why  sir  Ill strike nothing  I pray you 

Sirrah  I say  forbear Friend Valentine  a word 

My ears are stoppd and cannot hear good news 
So much of bad already hath possessd them 

Then in dumb silence will I bury mine 
For they are harsh  untuneable and bad 

Is Silvia dead 

No  Valentine 

No Valentine  indeed  for sacred Silvia 
Hath she forsworn me 

No  Valentine 

No Valentine  if Silvia have forsworn me 
What is your news 

Sir  there is a proclamation that you are vanished 

That thou art banished  O  thats the news 
From hence  from Silvia  and from me thy friend 

O  I have fed upon this woe already 
And now excess of it will make me surfeit 
Doth Silvia know that I am banished 

Ay  ay  and she hath offerd to the doom 
Which  unreversd  stands in effectual force 
A sea of melting pearl  which some call tears 
Those at her fathers churlish feet she tenderd 
With them  upon her knees  her humble self 
Wringing her hands  whose whiteness so became them 
As if but now they waxed pale for woe 
But neither bended knees  pure hands held up 
Sad sighs  deep groans  nor silvershedding tears 
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire 
But Valentine  if he be taen  must die 
Besides  her intercession chafd him so 
When she for thy repeal was suppliant 
That to close prison he commanded her 
With many bitter threats of biding there 

No more  unless the next word that thou speakst 
Have some malignant power upon my life 
If so  I pray thee  breathe it in mine ear 
As ending anthem of my endless dolour 

Cease to lament for that thou canst not help 
And study help for that which thou lamentst 
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good 
Here if thou stay  thou canst not see thy love 
Besides  thy staying will abridge thy life 
Hope is a lovers staff  walk hence with that 
And manage it against despairing thoughts 
Thy letters may be here  though thou art hence 
Which  being writ to me  shall be deliverd 
Even in the milkwhite bosom of thy love 
The time now serves not to expostulate 
Come  Ill convey thee through the citygate 
And  ere I part with thee  confer at large 
Of all that may concern thy loveaffairs 
As thou lovst Silvia  though not for thyself 
Regard thy danger  and along with me 

I pray thee  Launce  and if thou seest my boy 
Bid him make haste and meet me at the Northgate 

Go  sirrah  find him out  Come  Valentine 

O my dear Silvia  hapless Valentine 


I am but a fool  look you  and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave  but thats all one  if he be but one knave  He lives not now that knows me to be in love  yet I am in love  but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me  nor who tis I love  and yet tis a woman  but what woman  I will not tell myself  and yet tis a milkmaid  yet tis not a maid  for she hath had gossips  yet tis a maid  for she is her masters maid  and serves for wages  She hath more qualities than a waterspaniel which is much in a bare Christian 

Here is the catelog of her condition  Imprimis  She can fetch and carry  Why  a horse can do no more  nay  a horse cannot fetch  but only carry  therefore  is she better than a jade  Item  She can milk  look you  a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands 


How now  Signior Launce  what news with your mastership 

With my masters ship  why  it is at sea 

Well  your old vice still  mistake the word  What news  then  in your paper 

The blackest news that ever thou heardest 

Why  man  how black 

Why  as black as ink 

Let me read them 

Fie on thee  jolthead  thou canst not read 

Thou liest  I can 

I will try thee  Tell me this  who begot thee 

Marry  the son of my grandfather 

O  illiterate loiterer  it was the son of thy grandmother  This proves that thou canst not read 

Come  fool  come  try me in thy paper 

There  and Saint Nicholas be thy speed 

Imprimis  She can milk 

Ay  that she can 

Item  She brews good ale 

And thereof comes the proverb  Blessing of your heart  you brew good ale  

Item  She can sew 

Thats as much as to say  Can she so 

Item  She can knit 

What need a man care for a stock with a wench  when she can knit him a stock 

Item  She can wash and scour 

A special virtue  for then she need not be washed and scoured 

Item  She can spin 

Then may I set the world on wheels  when she can spin for her living 

Item  She hath many nameless virtues 

Thats as much as to say  bastard virtues  that  indeed  know not their fathers  and therefore have no names 

Here follow her vices 

Close at the heels of her virtues 

Item  She is not to be kissed fasting  in respect of her breath 

Well  that fault may be mended with a breakfast  Read on 

Item  She hath a sweet mouth 

That makes amends for her sour breath 

Item  She doth talk in her sleep 

Its no matter for that  so she sleep not in her talk 

Item  She is slow in words 

O villain  that set this down among her vices  To be slow in words is a womans only virtue  I pray thee  out witht  and place it for her chief virtue 

Item  She is proud 

Out with that too  it was Eves legacy  and cannot be taen from her 

Item  She hath no teeth 

I care not for that neither  because I love crusts 

Item  She is curst 

Well  the best is  she hath no teeth to bite 

Item  She will often praise her liquor 

If her liquor be good  she shall  if she will not  I will  for good things should be praised 

Item  She is too liberal 

Of her tongue she cannot  for thats writ down she is slow of  of her purse she shall not  for that Ill keep shut  now  of another thing she may  and that cannot I help  Well  proceed 

Item  She hath more hair than wit  and more faults than hairs  and more wealth than faults 

Stop there  Ill have her  she was mine  and not mine  twice or thrice in that last article  Rehearse that once more 

Item  She hath more hair than wit 

More hair than wit it may be  Ill prove it  the cover of the salt hides the salt  and therefore it is more than the salt  the hair  that covers the wit is more than the wit  for the greater hides the less  Whats next 

And more faults than hairs 

Thats monstrous  O  that that were out 

And more wealth than faults 

Why  that word makes the faults gracious  Well  Ill have her  and if it be a match  as nothing is impossible 

What then 

Why  then will I tell thee that thy master stays for thee at the Northgate 

For me 

For thee  ay  who art thou  he hath stayed for a better man than thee 

And must I go to him 

Thou must run to him  for thou hast stayed so long that going will scarce serve the turn 

Why didst not tell me sooner  pox of your loveletters 


Now will he be swingd for reading my letter  An unmannerly slave  that will thrust himself into secrets  Ill after  to rejoice in the boys correction 


Sir Thurio  fear not but that she will love you 
Now Valentine is banishd from her sight 

Since his exile she hath despisd me most 
Forsworn my company and raild at me 
That I am desperate of obtaining her 

This weak impress of love is as a figure 
Trenched in ice  which with an hours heat 
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form 
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts 
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot 


How now  Sir Proteus  Is your countryman 

According to our proclamation gone 

Gone  my good lord 

My daughter takes his going grievously 

A little time  my lord  will kill that grief 

So I believe  but Thurio thinks not so 
Proteus  the good conceit I hold of thee 
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert 
Makes me the better to confer with thee 

Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace 
Let me not live to look upon your Grace 

Thou knowst how willingly I would effect 
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter 

I do  my lord 

And also  I think  thou art not ignorant 
How she opposes her against my will 

She did  my lord  when Valentine was here 

Ay  and perversely she persevers so 
What might we do to make the girl forget 
The love of Valentine  and love Sir Thurio 

The best way is to slander Valentine 
With falsehood  cowardice  and poor descent 
Three things that women highly hold in hate 

Ay  but shell think that it is spoke in hate 

Ay  if his enemy deliver it 
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken 
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend 

Then you must undertake to slander him 

And that  my lord  I shall be loath to do 
Tis an ill office for a gentleman 
Especially against his very friend 

Where your good word cannot advantage him 
Your slander never can endamage him 
Therefore the office is indifferent 
Being entreated to it by your friend 

You have prevaild  my lord  If I can do it 
By aught that I can speak in his dispraise 
She shall not long continue love to him 
But say this weed her love from Valentine 
It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio 

Therefore  as you unwind her love from him 
Lest it should ravel and be good to none 
You must provide to bottom it on me 
Which must be done by praising me as much 
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine 

And  Proteus  we dare trust you in this kind 
Because we know  on Valentines report 
You are already Loves firm votary 
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind 
Upon this warrant shall you have access 
Where you with Silvia may confer at large 
For she is lumpish  heavy  melancholy 
And  for your friends sake  will be glad of you 
Where you may temper her  by your persuasion 
To hate young Valentine and love my friend 

As much as I can do I will effect 
But you  Sir Thurio  are not sharp enough 
You must lay lime to tangle her desires 
By wailful sonnets  whose composed rimes 
Should be fullfraught with serviceable vows 

Ay 
Much is the force of heavenbred poesy 

Say that upon the altar of her beauty 
You sacrifice your tears  your sighs  your heart 
Write till your ink be dry  and with your tears 
Moist it again  and frame some feeling line 
That may discover such integrity 
For Orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews 
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones 
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans 
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands 
After your direlamenting elegies 
Visit by night your ladys chamberwindow 
With some sweet consort  to their instruments 
Tune a deploring dump  the nights dead silence 
Will well become such sweetcomplaining grievance 
This  or else nothing  will inherit her 

This discipline shows thou hast been in love 

And thy advice this night Ill put in practice 
Therefore  sweet Proteus  my directiongiver 
Let us into the city presently 
To sort some gentlemen well skilld in music 
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn 
To give the onset to thy good advice 

About it  gentlemen 

Well wait upon your grace till aftersupper 
And afterward determine our proceedings 

Even now about it  I will pardon you 

Fellows  stand fast  I see a passenger 

If there be ten  shrink not  but down with em 


Stand  sir  and throw us that you have about ye 
If not  well make you sit and rifle you 

Sir  we are undone  these are the villains 
That all the travellers do fear so much 

My friends 

Thats not so  sir  we are your enemies 

Peace  well hear him 

Ay  by my beard  will we  for he is a proper man 

Then know  that I have little wealth to lose 
A man I am crossd with adversity 
My riches are these poor habiliments 
Of which if you should here disfurnish me 
You take the sum and substance that I have 

Whither travel you 

To Verona 

Whence came you 

From Milan 

Have you long sojournd there 

Some sixteen months  and longer might have stayd 
If crooked fortune had not thwarted me 

What  were you banishd thence 

I was 

For what offence 

For that which now torments me to rehearse 
I killd a man  whose death I much repent 
But yet I slew him manfully  in fight 
Without false vantage or base treachery 

Why  neer repent it  if it were done so 
But were you banishd for so small a fault 

I was  and held me glad of such a doom 

Have you the tongues 

My youthful travel therein made me happy 
Or else I often had been miserable 

By the bare scalp of Robin Hoods fat friar 
This fellow were a king for our wild faction 

Well have him  Sirs  a word 

Master  be one of them 
It is an honourable kind of thievery 

Peace  villain 

Tell us this  have you anything to take to 

Nothing  but my fortune 

Know then  that some of us are gentlemen 
Such as the fury of ungovernd youth 
Thrust from the company of awful men 
Myself was from Verona banished 
For practising to steal away a lady 
An heir  and near allied unto the duke 

And I from Mantua  for a gentleman 
Who  in my mood  I stabbd unto the heart 

And I for such like petty crimes as these 
But to the purpose  for we cite our faults 
That they may hold excusd our lawless lives 
And  partly  seeing you are beautified 
With goodly shape  and by your own report 
A linguist  and a man of such perfection 
As we do in our quality much want 

Indeed  because you are a banishd man 
Therefore  above the rest  we parley to you 
Are you content to be our general 
To make a virtue of necessity 
And live  as we do  in this wilderness 

What sayst thou  wilt thou be of our consort 
Say ay  and be the captain of us all 
Well do thee homage and be ruld by thee 
Love thee as our commander and our king 

But if thou scorn our courtesy  thou diest 

Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offerd 

I take your offer and will live with you 
Provided that you do no outrages 
On silly women  or poor passengers 

No  we detest such vile  base practices 
Come  go with us  well bring thee to our crews 
And show thee all the treasure we have got 
Which  with ourselves  all rest at thy dispose 


Already have I been false to Valentine 
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio 
Under the colour of commending him 
I have access my own love to prefer 
But Silvia is too fair  too true  too holy 
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts 
When I protest true loyalty to her 
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend 
When to her beauty I commend my vows 
She bids me think how I have been forsworn 
In breaking faith with Julia whom I lovd 
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips 
The least whereof would quell a lovers hope 
Yet  spaniellike  the more she spurns my love 
The more it grows  and fawneth on her still 
But here comes Thurio  now must we to her window 
And give some evening music to her ear 


How now  Sir Proteus  are you crept before us 

Ay  gentle Thurio  for you know that love 
Will creep in service where it cannot go 

Ay  but I hope  sir  that you love not here 

Sir  but I do  or else I would be hence 

Who  Silvia 

Ay  Silvia  for your sake 

I thank you for your own  Now  gentlemen 
Lets tune  and to it lustily a while 


Now  my young guest  methinks youre allycholly  I pray you  why is it 

Marry  mine host  because I cannot be merry 

Come  well have you merry  Ill bring you where you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for 

But shall I hear him speak 

Ay  that you shall 

That will be music 


Hark  hark 

Is he among these 

Ay  but peace  lets hear em 


Who is Silvia  what is she 
That all our swains commend her 
Holy  fair  and wise is she 
The heaven such grace did lend her 
That she might admired be 
Is she kind as she is fair 
For beauty lives with kindness 
Love doth to her eyes repair 
To help him of his blindness 
And  being helpd  inhabits there 
Then to Silvia let us sing 
That Silvia is excelling 
She excels each mortal thing 
Upon the dull earth dwelling 
To her let us garlands bring 

How now  are you sadder than you were before  How do you  man  the music likes you not 

You mistake  the musician likes me not 

Why  my pretty youth 

He plays false  father 

How  out of tune on the strings 

Not so  but yet so false that he grieves my very heartstrings 

You have a quick ear 

Ay  I would I were deaf  it makes me have a slow heart 

I perceive you delight not in music 

Not a whit when it jars so 

Hark  what fine change is in the music 

Ay  that change is the spite 

You would have them always play but one thing 

I would always have one play but one thing 
But  host  doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on 
Often resort unto this gentlewoman 

I will tell you what Launce  his man  told me  he lovd her out of all nick 

Where is Launce 

Gone to seek his dog  which  tomorrow  by his masters command  he must carry for a present to his lady 

Peace  stand aside  the company parts 

Sir Thurio  fear not you  I will so plead 
That you shall say my cunning drift excels 

Where meet we 

At Saint Gregorys well 

Farewell 

Madam  good even to your ladyship 

I thank you for your music  gentlemen 
Who is that that spake 

One  lady  if you knew his pure hearts truth 
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice 

Sir Proteus  as I take it 

Sir Proteus  gentle lady  and your servant 

What is your will 

That I may compass yours 

You have your wish  my will is even this 
That presently you hie you home to bed 
Thou subtle  perjurd  false  disloyal man 
Thinkst thou I am so shallow  so conceitless 
To be seduced by thy flattery 
That hast deceivd so many with thy vows 
Return  return  and make thy love amends 
For me  by this pale queen of night I swear 
I am so far from granting thy request 
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit 
And by and by intend to chide myself 
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee 

I grant  sweet love  that I did love a lady 
But she is dead 

Tware false  if I should speak it 
For I am sure she is not buried 

Say that she be  yet Valentine thy friend 
Survives  to whom  thyself art witness 
I am betrothd  and art thou not ashamd 
To wrong him with thy importunacy 

I likewise hear that Valentine is dead 

And so suppose am I  for in his grave  Assure thyself my love is buried 

Sweet lady  let me rake it from the earth 

Go to thy ladys grave and call hers thence 
Or  at the least  in hers sepulchre thine 

He heard not that 

Madam  if your heart be so obdurate 
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love 
The picture that is hanging in your chamber 
To that Ill speak  to that Ill sigh and weep 
For since the substance of your perfect self 
Is else devoted  I am but a shadow 
And to your shadow will I make true love 

If twere a substance  you would  sure  deceive it 
And make it but a shadow  as I am 

I am very loath to be your idol  sir 
But  since your falsehood shall become you well 
To worship shadows and adore false shapes 
Send to me in the morning and Ill send it 
And so  good rest 

As wretches have oer night 
That wait for execution in the morn 


Host  will you go 

By my halidom  I was fast asleep 

Pray you  where lies Sir Proteus 

Marry  at my house  Trust me  I think tis almost day 

Not so  but it hath been the longest night 
That eer I watchd and the most heaviest 


This is the hour that Madam Silvia 
Entreated me to call  and know her mind 
Theres some great matter shed employ me in 
Madam  Madam 


Who calls 

Your servant  and your friend 
One that attends your ladyships command 

Sir Eglamour  a thousand times good morrow 

As many  worthy lady  to yourself 
According to your ladyships impose 
I am thus early come to know what service 
It is your pleasure to command me in 

O Eglamour  thou art a gentleman 
Think not I flatter  for I swear I do not 
Valiant  wise  remorseful  wellaccomplishd 
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will 
I bear unto the banishd Valentine 
Nor how my father would enforce me marry 
Vain Thurio  whom my very soul abhors 
Thyself hast lovd  and I have heard thee say 
No grief did ever come so near thy heart 
As when thy lady and thy true love died 
Upon whose grave thou vowdst pure chastity 
Sir Eglamour  I would to Valentine 
To Mantua  where  I hear he makes abode 
And  for the ways are dangerous to pass 
I do desire thy worthy company 
Upon whose faith and honour I repose 
Urge not my fathers anger  Eglamour 
But think upon my grief  a ladys grief 
And on the justice of my flying hence 
To keep me from a most unholy match 
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues 
I do desire thee  even from a heart 
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands 
To bear me company and go with me 
If not  to hide what I have said to thee 
That I may venture to depart alone 

Madam  I pity much your grievances 
Which since I know they virtuously are placd 
I give consent to go along with you 
Recking as little what betideth me 
As much I wish all good befortune you 
When will you go 

This evening coming 

Where shall I meet you 

At Friar Patricks cell 
Where I intend holy confession 

I will not fail your ladyship 
Good morrow  gentle lady 

Good morrow  kind Sir Eglamour 


When a mans servant shall play the cur with him  look you  it goes hard  one that I brought up of a puppy  one that I saved from drowning  when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it  I have taught him  even as one would say precisely  Thus would I teach a dog  I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master  and I came no sooner into the diningchamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capons leg  O  tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies  I would have  as one should say  one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed  to be  as it were  a dog at all things  If I had not had more wit than he  to take a fault upon me that he did  I think verily he had been hanged fort  sure as I live  he had suffered fort  you shall judge  He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the dukes table  he had not been there bless the mark a pissingwhile  but all the chamber smelt him  Out with the dog  says one  What cur is that  says another  Whip him out  says the third  Hang him up  says the duke  I  having been acquainted with the smell before  knew it was Crab  and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs  Friend  quoth I  you mean to whip the dog  Ay  marry  do I  quoth he  You do him the more wrong  quoth I  twas I did the thing you wot of  He makes me no more ado  but whips me out of the chamber  How many masters would do this for his servant  Nay  Ill be sworn  I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen  otherwise he had been executed  I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed  otherwise he had suffered fort  thou thinkest not of this now  Nay  I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia  did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do  When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewomans farthingale  Didst thou ever see me do such a trick 


Sebastian is thy name  I like thee well 
And will employ thee in some service presently 

In what you please  I will do what I can 

I hope thou wilt 

How now  you whoreson peasant 
Where have you been these two days loitering 

Marry  sir  I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me 

And what says she to my little jewel 

Marry  she says  your dog was a cur  and tells you  currish thanks is good enough for such a present 

But she received my dog 

No  indeed  did she not  here have I brought him back again 

What  didst thou offer her this from me 

Ay  sir  the other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman boys in the marketplace  and then I offered her mine own  who is a dog as big as ten of yours  and therefore the gift the greater 

Go  get thee hence  and find my dog again 
Or neer return again into my sight 
Away  I say  Stayst thou to vex me here 
A slave that still an end turns me to shame 

Sebastian  I have entertained thee 
Partly  that I have need of such a youth 
That can with some discretion do my business 
Fort is no trusting to yond foolish lout 
But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour 
Which  if my augury deceive me not 
Witness good bringing up  fortune  and truth 
Therefore  know thou  for this I entertain thee 
Go presently  and take this ring with thee 
Deliver it to Madam Silvia 
She lovd me well deliverd it to me 

It seems  you lovd not her  to leave her token 
Shes dead  belike 

Not so  I think  she lives 

Alas 

Why dost thou cry alas  

I cannot choose 
But pity her 

Wherefore shouldst thou pity her 

Because methinks that she lovd you as well 
As you do love your lady Silvia 
She dreams on him that has forgot her love 
You dote on her  that cares not for your love 
Tis pity  love should be so contrary 
And thinking on it makes me cry  alas  

Well  well  give her that ring and therewithal 
This letter  thats her chamber  Tell my lady 
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture 
Your message done  hie home unto my chamber 
Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary 


How many women would do such a message 
Alas  poor Proteus  thou hast entertaind 
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs 
Alas  poor fool  why do I pity him 
That with his very heart despiseth me 
Because he loves her  he despiseth me 
Because I love him  I must pity him 
This ring I gave him when he parted from me 
To bind him to remember my good will 
And now am I unhappy messenger 
To plead for that which I would not obtain 
To carry that which I would have refusd 
To praise his faith which I would have dispraisd 
I am my masters trueconfirmed love 
But cannot be true servant to my master 
Unless I prove false traitor to myself 
Yet will I woo for him  but yet so coldly 
As heaven it knows  I would not have him speed 


Gentlewoman  good day  I pray you  be my mean 

To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia 

What would you with her  if that I be she 

If you be she  I do entreat your patience To hear me speak the message I am sent on 

From whom 

From my master  Sir Proteus  madam 

O  he sends you for a picture 

Ay  madam 

Ursula  bring my picture there 

Go  give your master this  tell him from me 
One Julia  that his changing thoughts forget 
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow 

Madam  please you peruse this letter 
Pardon me  madam  I have unadvisd 
Deliverd you a paper that I should not 
This is the letter to your ladyship 

I pray thee  let me look on that again 

It may not be  good madam  pardon me 

There  hold 
I will not look upon your masters lines 
I know  they are stuffd with protestations 
And full of newfound oaths  which he will break 
As easily as I do tear his paper 

Madam  he sends your ladyship this ring 

The more shame for him that he sends it me 
For  I have heard him say a thousand times 
His Julia gave it him at his departure 
Though his false finger have profand the ring 
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong 

She thanks you 

What sayst thou 

I thank you  madam  that you tender her 
Poor gentlewoman  my master wrongs her much 

Dost thou know her 

Almost as well as I do know myself 
To think upon her woes  I do protest 
That I have wept a hundred several times 

Belike  she thinks  that Proteus hath forsook her 

I think she doth  and thats her cause of sorrow 

Is she not passing fair 

She hath been fairer  madam  than she is 
When she did think my master lovd her well 
She  in my judgment  was as fair as you 
But since she did neglect her lookingglass 
And threw her sunexpelling mask away 
The air hath starvd the roses in her cheeks 
And pinchd the lilytincture of her face 
That now she is become as black as I 

How tall was she 

About my stature  for  at Pentecost 
When all our pageants of delight were playd 
Our youth got me to play the womans part 
And I was trimmd in Madam Julias gown 
Which served me as fit  by all mens judgments 
As if the garment had been made for me 
Therefore I know she is about my height 
And at that time I made her weep agood 
For I did play a lamentable part 
Madam  twas Ariadne passioning 
For Theseus perjury and unjust flight 
Which I so lively acted with my tears 
That my poor mistress  moved therewithal 
Wept bitterly  and would I might be dead 
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow 

She is beholding to thee  gentle youth 
Alas  poor lady  desolate and left 
I weep myself to think upon thy words 
Here  youth  there is my purse  I give thee this 
For thy sweet mistress sake  because thou lovst her 
Farewell 

And she shall thank you fort  if eer you know her 

A virtuous gentlewoman  mild and beautiful 
I hope my masters suit will be but cold 
Since she respects my mistress love so much 
Alas  how love can trifle with itself 
Here is her picture  let me see  I think 
If I had such a tire  this face of mine 
Were full as lovely as is this of hers 
And yet the painter flatterd her a little 
Unless I flatter with myself too much 
Her hair is auburn  mine is perfect yellow 
If that be all the difference in his love 
Ill get me such a colourd periwig 
Her eyes are grey as glass  and so are mine 
Ay  but her foreheads low  and mines as high 
What should it be that he respects in her 
But I can make respective in myself 
If this fond Love were not a blinded god 
Come  shadow  come  and take this shadow up 
For tis thy rival  O thou senseless form 
Thou shalt be worshippd  kissd  lovd  and adord 
And  were there sense in his idolatry 
My substance should be statue in thy stead 
Ill use thee kindly for thy mistress sake 
That usd me so  or else  by Jove I vow 
I should have scratchd out your unseeing eyes 
To make my master out of love with thee 

The sun begins to gild the western sky 
And now it is about the very hour 
That Silvia at Friar Patricks cell should meet me 
She will not fail  for lovers break not hours 
Unless it be to come before their time 
So much they spur their expedition 
See  where she comes 

Lady  a happy evening 

Amen  amen  go on  good Eglamour 
Out at the postern by the abbeywall 
I fear I am attended by some spies 

Fear not  the forest is not three leagues off 
If we recover that  were sure enough 


Sir Proteus  what says Silvia to my suit 

O  sir  I find her milder than she was 
And yet she takes exceptions at your person 

What  that my leg is too long 

No  that it is too little 

Ill wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder 

But love will not be spurrd to what it loathes 

What says she to my face 

She says it is a fair one 

Nay then  the wanton lies  my face is black 

But pearls are fair  and the old saying is 
Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies eyes  

Tis true  such pearls as put out ladies eyes 
For I had rather wink than look on them 

How likes she my discourse 

Ill  when you talk of war 

But well  when I discourse of love and peace 

But better  indeed  when you hold your peace 

What says she to my valour 

O  sir  she makes no doubt of that 

She needs not  when she knows it cowardice 

What says she to my birth 

That you are well derivd 

True  from a gentleman to a fool 

Considers she my possessions 

O  ay  and pities them 

Wherefore 

That such an ass should owe them 

That they are out by lease 

Here comes the duke 


How now  Sir Proteus  how now  Thurio 
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late 

Not I 

Nor I 

Saw you my daughter 

Neither 

Why then 
Shes fled unto that peasant Valentine 
And Eglamour is in her company 
Tis true  for Friar Laurence met them both 
As he in penance wanderd through the forest 
Him he knew well  and guessd that it was she 
But  being maskd  he was not sure of it 
Besides  she did intend confession 
At Patricks cell this even  and there she was not 
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence 
Therefore  I pray you  stand not to discourse 
But mount you presently and meet with me 
Upon the rising of the mountainfoot 
That leads towards Mantua  whither they are fled 
Dispatch  sweet gentlemen  and follow me 


Why  this it is to be a peevish girl 
That flies her fortune when it follows her 
Ill after  more to be revengd on Eglamour 
Than for the love of reckless Silvia 


And I will follow  more for Silvias love 
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her 


And I will follow  more to cross that love 
Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love 


Come  come 
Be patient  we must bring you to our captain 

A thousand more mischances than this one 
Have learnd me how to brook this patiently 

Come  bring her away 

Where is the gentleman that was with her 

Being nimblefooted  he hath outrun us 
But Moyses and Valerius follow him 
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood 
There is our captain  Well follow him thats fled 
The thicket is beset  he cannot scape 


Come  I must bring you to our captains cave 
Fear not  he bears an honourable mind 
And will not use a woman lawlessly 

O Valentine  this I endure for thee 


How use doth breed a habit in a man 
This shadowy desart  unfrequented woods 
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns 
Here can I sit alone  unseen of any 
And to the nightingales complaining notes 
Tune my distresses and record my woes 
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast 
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless 
Lest  growing ruinous  the building fall 
And leave no memory of what it was 
Repair me with thy presence  Silvia 
Thou gentle nymph  cherish thy forlorn swain 

What halloing and what stir is this today 
These are my mates  that make their wills their law 
Have some unhappy passenger in chase 
They love me well  yet I have much to do 
To keep them from uncivil outrages 
Withdraw thee  Valentine  whos this comes here 

Madam  this service I have done for you 
Though you respect not aught your servant doth 
To hazard life and rescue you from him 
That would have forcd your honour and your love 
Vouchsafe me  for my meed  but one fair look 
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg 
And less than this  I am sure  you cannot give 

How like a dream is this I see and hear 
Love  lend me patience to forbear awhile 

O  miserable  unhappy that I am 

Unhappy were you  madam  ere I came 
But by my coming I have made you happy 

By thy approach thou makst me most unhappy 

And me  when he approacheth to your presence 

Had I been seized by a hungry lion 
I would have been a breakfast to the beast 
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me 
O  heaven be judge how I love Valentine 
Whose lifes as tender to me as my soul 
And full as much for more there cannot be 
I do detest false perjurd Proteus 
Therefore be gone  solicit me no more 

What dangerous action  stood it next to death 
Would I not undergo for one calm look 
O  tis the curse in love  and still approvd 
When women cannot love where theyre belovd 

When Proteus cannot love where hes belovd 
Read over Julias heart  thy first best love 
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith 
Into a thousand oaths  and all those oaths 
Descended into perjury to love me 
Thou hast no faith left now  unless thoudst two 
And thats far worse than none  better have none 
Than plural faith which is too much by one 
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend 

In love 
Who respects friend 

All men but Proteus 

Nay  if the gentle spirit of moving words 
Can no way change you to a milder form 
Ill woo you like a soldier  at arms end 
And love you gainst the nature of love force ye 

O heaven 

Ill force thee yield to my desire 

Ruffian  let go that rude uncivil touch 
Thou friend of an ill fashion 

Valentine 

Thou common friend  thats without faith or love 
For such is a friend now treachrous man 
Thou hast beguild my hopes  naught but mine eye 
Could have persuaded me  Now I dare not say 
I have one friend alive  thou wouldst disprove me 
Who should be trusted now  when ones right hand 
Is perjurd to the bosom  Proteus 
I am sorry I must never trust thee more 
But count the world a stranger for thy sake 
The private wound is deepst  O time most curst 
Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst 

My shame and guilt confound me 
Forgive me  Valentine  If hearty sorrow 
Be a sufficient ransom for offence 
I tendert here  I do as truly suffer 
As eer I did commit 

Then  I am paid 
And once again I do receive thee honest 
Who by repentance is not satisfied 
Is nor of heaven  nor earth  for these are pleasd 
By penitence the Eternals wraths appeasd 
And  that my love may appear plain and free 
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee 

O me unhappy 


Look to the boy 

Why  boy  why  wag  how now  whats the matter 
Look up  speak 

O good sir  my master chargd me 
To deliver a ring to Madam Silvia 
Which out of my neglect was never done 

Where is that ring  boy 

Here tis this is it 


How  let me see 
Why this is the ring I gave to Julia 

O  cry you mercy  sir  I have mistook 
This is the ring you sent to Silvia 


But how camst thou by this ring 
At my depart I gave this unto Julia 

And Julia herself did give it me 
And Julia herself hath brought it hither 

How  Julia 

Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths 
And entertaind them deeply in her heart 
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root 
O Proteus  let this habit make thee blush 
Be thou ashamd that I have took upon me 
Such an immodest raiment  if shame live 
In a disguise of love 
It is the lesser blot  modesty finds 
Women to change their shapes than men their minds 

Than men their minds  tis true  O heaven  were man 
But constant  he were perfect  that one error 
Fills him with faults  makes him run through all the sins 
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins 
What is in Silvias face  but I may spy 
More fresh in Julias with a constant eye 

Come  come  a hand from either 
Let me be blest to make this happy close 
Twere pity two such friends should be long foes 

Bear witness  heaven  I have my wish  for ever 

And I mine 


A prize  a prize  a prize 

Forbear  forbear  I say  it is my lord the duke 
Your Grace is welcome to a man disgracd 
Banished Valentine 

Sir Valentine 

Yonder is Silvia  and Silvias mine 

Thurio  give back  or else embrace thy death 
Come not within the measure of my wrath 
Do not name Silvia thine  if once again 
Verona shall not hold thee  Here she stands 
Take but possession of her with a touch 
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love 

Sir Valentine  I care not for her  I 
I hold him but a fool that will endanger 
His body for a girl that loves him not 
I claim her not  and therefore she is thine 

The more degenerate and base art thou 
To make such means for her as thou hast done 
And leave her on such slight conditions 
Now  by the honour of my ancestry 
I do applaud thy spirit  Valentine 
And think thee worthy of an empress love 
Know then  I here forget all former griefs 
Cancel all grudge  repeal thee home again 
Plead a new state in thy unrivalld merit 
To which I thus subscribe  Sir Valentine 
Thou art a gentleman and well derivd 
Take thou thy Silvia  for thou hast deservd her 

I thank your Grace  the gift hath made me happy 
I now beseech you  for your daughters sake 
To grant one boon that I shall ask of you 

I grant it  for thine own  whateer it be 

These banishd men  that I have kept withal 
Are men endud with worthy qualities 
Forgive them what they have committed here 
And let them be recalld from their exile 
They are reformed  civil  full of good 
And fit for great employment  worthy lord 

Thou hast prevaild  I pardon them  and thee 
Dispose of them as thou knowst their deserts 
Come  let us go  we will include all jars 
With triumphs  mirth  and rare solemnity 

And as we walk along  I dare be bold 
With our discourse to make your Grace to smile 
What think you of this page  my lord 

I think the boy hath grace in him  he blushes 

I warrant you  my lord  more grace than boy 

What mean you by that saying 

Please you  Ill tell you as we pass along 
That you will wonder what hath fortuned 
Come  Proteus  tis your penance  but to hear 
The story of your loves discovered 
That done  our day of marriage shall be yours 
One feast  one house  one mutual happiness
