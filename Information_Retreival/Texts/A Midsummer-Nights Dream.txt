A MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM

Now  fair Hippolyta  our nuptial hour 
Draws on apace  four happy days bring in 
Another moon  but O  methinks how slow 
This old moon wanes  she lingers my desires 
Like to a step dame  or a dowager 
Long withering out a young mans revenue 

Four days will quickly steep themselves in night 
Four nights will quickly dream away the time 
And then the moon  like to a silver bow 
Newbent in heaven  shall behold the night 
Of our solemnities 

Go  Philostrate 
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments 
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth 
Turn melancholy forth to funerals 
The pale companion is not for our pomp 

Hippolyta  I wood thee with my sword 
And won thy love doing thee injuries 
But I will wed thee in another key 
With pomp  with triumph  and with revelling 


Happy be Theseus  our renowned duke 

Thanks  good Egeus  whats the news with thee 

Full of vexation come I  with complaint 
Against my child  my daughter Hermia 
Stand forth  Demetrius  My noble lord 
This man hath my consent to marry her 
Stand forth  Lysander  and  my gracious duke 
This man hath bewitchd the bosom of my child 
Thou  thou  Lysander  thou hast given her rimes 
And interchangd lovetokens with my child 
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung 
With feigning voice  verses of feigning love 
And stoln the impression of her fantasy 
With bracelets of thy hair  rings  gawds  conceits 
Knacks  trifles  nosegays  sweetmeats  messengers 
Of strong prevailment in unhardend youth 
With cunning hast thou filchd my daughters heart 
Turnd her obedience  which is due to me 
To stubborn harshness  And  my gracious duke 
Be it so she will not here before your Grace 
Consent to marry with Demetrius 
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens 
As she is mine  I may dispose of her 
Which shall be either to this gentleman 
Or to her death  according to our law 
Immediately provided in that case 

What say you  Hermia  be advisd  fair maid 
To you  your father should be as a god 
One that composd your beauties  yea  and one 
To whom you are but as a form in wax 
By him imprinted  and within his power 
To leave the figure or disfigure it 
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman 

So is Lysander 

In himself he is 
But  in this kind  wanting your fathers voice 
The other must be held the worthier 

I would my father lookd but with my eyes 

Rather your eyes must with his judgment look 

I do entreat your Grace to pardon me 
I know not by what power I am made bold 
Nor how it may concern my modesty 
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts 
But I beseech your Grace  that I may know 
The worst that may befall me in this case 
If I refuse to wed Demetrius 

Either to die the death  or to abjure 
For ever the society of men 
Therefore  fair Hermia  question your desires 
Know of your youth  examine well your blood 
Wher  if you yield not to your fathers choice 
You can endure the livery of a nun 
For aye to be in shady cloister mewd 
To live a barren sister all your life 
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon 
Thrice blessed they that master so their blood 
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage 
But earthlier happy is the rose distilld 
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn 
Grows  lives  and dies  in single blessedness 

So will I grow  so live  so die  my lord 
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up 
Unto his lordship  whose unwished yoke 
My soul consents not to give sovereignty 

Take time to pause  and  by the next new moon 
The sealingday betwixt my love and me 
For everlasting bond of fellowship 
Upon that day either prepare to die 
For disobedience to your fathers will 
Or else to wed Demetrius  as he would 
Or on Dianas altar to protest 
For aye austerity and single life 

Relent  sweet Hermia  and  Lysander  yield 
Thy crazed title to my certain right 

You have her fathers love  Demetrius 
Let me have Hermias  do you marry him 

Scornful Lysander  true  he hath my love 
And what is mine my love shall render him 
And she is mine  and all my right of her 
I do estate unto Demetrius 

I am  my lord  as well derivd as he 
As well possessd  my love is more than his 
My fortunes every way as fairly rankd 
If not with vantage  as Demetrius 
And  which is more than all these boasts can be 
I am belovd of beauteous Hermia 
Why should not I then prosecute my right 
Demetrius  Ill avouch it to his head 
Made love to Nedars daughter  Helena 
And won her soul  and she  sweet lady  dotes 
Devoutly dotes  dotes in idolatry 
Upon this spotted and inconstant man 

I must confess that I have heard so much 
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof 
But  being overfull of selfaffairs 
My mind did lose it  But  Demetrius  come 
And come  Egeus  you shall go with me 
I have some private schooling for you both 
For you  fair Hermia  look you arm yourself 
To fit your fancies to your fathers will 
Or else the law of Athens yields you up 
Which by no means we may extenuate 
To death  or to a vow of single life 
Come  my Hippolyta  what cheer  my love 
Demetrius and Egeus  go along 
I must employ you in some business 
Against our nuptial  and confer with you 
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves 

With duty and desire we follow you 


How now  my love  Why is your cheek so pale 
How chance the roses there do fade so fast 

Belike for want of rain  which I could well 
Beteem them from the tempest of mine eyes 

Ay me  for aught that ever I could read 
Could ever hear by tale or history 
The course of true love never did run smooth 
But  either it was different in blood 

O cross  too high to be enthralld to low 

Or else misgraffed in respect of years 

O spite  too old to be engagd to young 

Or else it stood upon the choice of friends 

O hell  to choose love by anothers eye 

Or  if there were a sympathy in choice 
War  death  or sickness did lay siege to it 
Making it momentany as a sound 
Swift as a shadow  short as any dream 
Brief as the lightning in the collied night 
That  in a spleen  unfolds both heaven and earth 
And ere a man hath power to say  Behold  
The jaws of darkness do devour it up 
So quick bright things come to confusion 

If then true lovers have been ever crossd 
It stands as an edict in destiny 
Then let us teach our trial patience 
Because it is a customary cross 
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs 
Wishes and tears  poor fancys followers 

A good persuasion  therefore  hear me  Hermia 
I have a widow aunt  a dowager 
Of great revenue  and she hath no child 
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues 
And she respects me as her only son 
There  gentle Hermia  may I marry thee 
And to that place the sharp Athenian law 
Cannot pursue us  If thou lovst me then 
Steal forth thy fathers house tomorrow night 
And in the wood  a league without the town 
Where I did meet thee once with Helena 
To do observance to a morn of May 
There will I stay for thee 

My good Lysander 
I swear to thee by Cupids strongest bow 
By his best arrow with the golden head 
By the simplicity of Venus doves 
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves 
And by that fire which burnd the Carthage queen 
When the false Troyan under sail was seen 
By all the vows that ever men have broke 
In number more than ever women spoke 
In that same place thou hast appointed me 
Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee 

Keep promise  love  Look  here comes Helena 


God speed fair Helena  Whither away 

Call you me fair  that fair again unsay 
Demetrius loves your fair  O happy fair 
Your eyes are lodestars  and your tongues sweet air 
More tuneable than lark to shepherds ear 
When wheat is green  when hawthorn buds appear 
Sickness is catching  O  were favour so 
Yours would I catch  fair Hermia  ere I go 
My ear should catch your voice  my eye your eye 
My tongue should catch your tongues sweet melody 
Were the world mine  Demetrius being bated 
The rest Id give to be to you translated 
O  teach me how you look  and with what art 
You sway the motion of Demetrius heart 

I frown upon him  yet he loves me still 

O  that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill 

I give him curses  yet he gives me love 

O  that my prayers could such affection move 

The more I hate  the more he follows me 

The more I love  the more he hateth me 

His folly  Helena  is no fault of mine 

None  but your beauty  would that fault were mine 

Take comfort  he no more shall see my face 
Lysander and myself will fly this place 
Before the time I did Lysander see 
Seemd Athens as a paradise to me 
O  then  what graces in my love do dwell 
That he hath turnd a heaven unto a hell 

Helen  to you our minds we will unfold 
Tomorrow night  when Ph be doth behold 
Her silver visage in the watry glass 
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass 
A time that lovers flights doth still conceal 
Through Athens gates have we devisd to steal 

And in the wood  where often you and I 
Upon faint primrosebeds were wont to lie 
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet 
There my Lysander and myself shall meet 
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes 
To seek new friends and stranger companies 
Farewell  sweet playfellow  pray thou for us 
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius 
Keep word  Lysander  we must starve our sight 
From lovers food till morrow deep midnight 

I will  my Hermia 

Helena  adieu 
As you on him  Demetrius dote on you 


How happy some oer other some can be 
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she 
But what of that  Demetrius thinks not so 
He will not know what all but he do know 
And as he errs  doting on Hermias eyes 
So I  admiring of his qualities 
Things base and vile  holding no quantity 
Love can transpose to form and dignity 
Love looks not with the eyes  but with the mind 
And therefore is wingd Cupid painted blind 
Nor hath Loves mind of any judgment taste 
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste 
And therefore is Love said to be a child 
Because in choice he is so oft beguild 
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear 
So the boy Love is perjurd every where 
For ere Demetrius lookd on Hermias eyne 
He haild down oaths that he was only mine 
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt 
So he dissolvd  and showers of oaths did melt 
I will go tell him of fair Hermias flight 
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night 
Pursue her  and for this intelligence 
If I have thanks  it is a dear expense 
But herein mean I to enrich my pain 
To have his sight thither and back again 


Is all our company here 

You were best to call them generally  man by man  according to the scrip 

Here is the scroll of every mans name  which is thought fit  through all Athens  to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess on his weddingday at night 

First  good Peter Quince  say what the play treats on  then read the names of the actors  and so grow to a point 

Marry  our play is  The most lamentable comedy  and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby 

A very good piece of work  I assure you  and a merry  Now  good Peter Quince  call forth your actors by the scroll  Masters  spread yourselves 

Answer as I call you  Nick Bottom  the weaver 

Ready  Name what part I am for  and proceed 

You  Nick Bottom  are set down for Pyramus 

What is Pyramus  a lover  or a tyrant 

A lover  that kills himself most gallantly for love 

That will ask some tears in the true performing of it  if I do it  let the audience look to their eyes  I will move storms  I will condole in some measure  To the rest  yet my chief humour is for a tyrant  I could play Ercles rarely  or a part to tear a cat in  to make all split 

The raging rocks 
And shivering shocks 
Shall break the locks 
Of prison gates 
And Phibbus car 
Shall shine from far 
And make and mar 
The foolish Fates 

This was lofty  Now name the rest of the players  This is Ercles vein  a tyrants vein  a lover is more condoling 

Francis Flute  the bellowsmender 

Here  Peter Quince 

You must take Thisby on you 

What is Thisby  a wandering knight 

It is the lady that Pyramus must love 

Nay  faith  let not me play a woman  I have a beard coming 

Thats all one  you shall play it in a mask  and you may speak as small as you will 

An I may hide my face  let me play Thisby too  Ill speak in a monstrous little voice  Thisne  Thisne  Ah  Pyramus  my lover dear  thy Thisby dear  and lady dear  

No  no  you must play Pyramus  and Flute  you Thisby 

Well  proceed 

Robin Starveling  the tailor 

Here  Peter Quince 

Robin Starveling  you must play Thisbys mother  Tom Snout  the tinker 

Here  Peter Quince 

You  Pyramuss father  myself  Thisbys father  Snug  the joiner  you the lions part  and  I hope  here is a play fitted 

Have you the lions part written  pray you  if it be  give it me  for I am slow of study 

You may do it extempore  for it is nothing but roaring 

Let me play the lion too  I will roar  that I will do any mans heart good to hear me  I will roar  that I will make the duke say  Let him roar again  let him roar again  

An you should do it too terribly  you would fright the duchess and the ladies  that they would shriek  and that were enough to hang us all 

That would hang us  every mothers son 

I grant you  friends  if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits  they would have no more discretion but to hang us  but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove  I will roar you as twere any nightingale 

You can play no part but Pyramus  for Pyramus is a sweetfaced man  a proper man  as one shall see in a summers day  a most lovely  gentlemanlike man  therefore  you must needs play Pyramus 

Well  I will undertake it  What beard were I best to play it in 

Why  what you will 

I will discharge it in either your strawcolour beard  your orangetawny beard  your purpleingrain beard  or your Frenchcrown colour beard  your perfect yellow 

Some of your French crowns have no hair at all  and then you will play barefaced  But masters  here are your parts  and I am to entreat you  request you  and desire you  to con them by tomorrow night  and meet me in the palace wood  a mile without the town  by moonlight  there will we rehearse  for if we meet in the city  we shall be dogged with company  and our devices known  In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties  such as our play wants  I pray you  fail me not 

We will meet  and there we may rehearse more obscenely and courageously  Take pains  be perfect  adieu 

At the dukes oak we meet 

Enough  hold  or cut bowstrings 

How now  spirit  whither wander you 


Over hill  over dale 
Thorough bush  thorough brier 
Over park  over pale 
Thorough flood  thorough fire 
I do wander every where 
Swifter than the moones sphere 
And I serve the fairy queen 
To dew her orbs upon the green 
The cowslips tall her pensioners be 
In their gold coats spots you see 
Those be rubies  fairy favours 
In their freckles live their savours 

I must go seek some dewdrops here 
And hang a pearl in every cowslips ear 
Farewell  thou lob of spirits  Ill be gone 
Our queen and all her elves come here anon 

The king doth keep his revels here tonight 
Take heed the queen come not within his sight 
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath 
Because that she as her attendant hath 
A lovely boy  stoln from an Indian king 
She never had so sweet a changeling 
And jealous Oberon would have the child 
Knight of his train  to trace the forests wild 
But she  perforce  withholds the loved boy 
Crowns him with flowers  and makes him all her joy 
And now they never meet in grove  or green 
By fountain clear  or spangled starlight sheen 
But they do square  that all their elves  for fear 
Creep into acorncups and hide them there 

Either I mistake your shape and making quite 
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite 
Calld Robin Goodfellow  are you not he 
That frights the maidens of the villagery 
Skim milk  and sometimes labour in the quern 
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn 
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm 
Mislead nightwanderers  laughing at their harm 
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck 
You do their work  and they shall have good luck 
Are you not he 

Fairy  thou speakst aright 
I am that merry wanderer of the night 
I jest to Oberon  and make him smile 
When I a fat and beanfed horse beguile 
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal 
And sometime lurk I in a gossips bowl 
In very likeness of a roasted crab 
And  when she drinks  against her lips I bob 
And on her witherd dewlap pour the ale 
The wisest aunt  telling the saddest tale 
Sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me 
Then slip I from her bum  down topples she 
And tailor cries  and falls into a cough 
And then the whole quire hold their hips and loff 
And waxen in their mirth  and neeze  and swear 
A merrier hour was never wasted there 
But  room  fairy  here comes Oberon 

And here my mistress  Would that he were gone 


Ill met by moonlight  proud Titania 

What  jealous Oberon  Fairies  skip hence 
I have forsworn his bed and company 

Tarry  rash wanton  am not I thy lord 

Then  I must be thy lady  but I know 
When thou hast stoln away from fairy land 
And in the shape of Corin sat all day 
Playing on pipes of corn  and versing love 
To amorous Phillida  Why art thou here 
Come from the furthest steppe of India 
But that  forsooth  the bouncing Amazon 
Your buskind mistress and your warrior love 
To Theseus must be wedded  and you come 
To give their bed joy and prosperity 

How canst thou thus for shame  Titania 
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta 
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus 
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night 
From Perigouna  whom he ravished 
And make him with fair  gle break his faith 
With Ariadne  and Antiopa 

These are the forgeries of jealousy 
And never  since the middle summers spring 
Met we on hill  in dale  forest  or mead 
By paved fountain  or by rushy brook 
Or in the beached margent of the sea 
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind 
But with thy brawls thou hast disturbd our sport 
Therefore the winds  piping to us in vain 
As in revenge  have suckd up from the sea 
Contagious fogs  which  falling in the land 
Have every pelting river made so proud 
That they have overborne their continents 
The ox hath therefore stretchd his yoke in vain 
The ploughman lost his sweat  and the green corn 
Hath rotted ere his youth attaind a beard 
The fold stands empty in the drowned field 
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock 
The nine mens morris is filld up with mud 
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green 
For lack of tread are undistinguishable 
The human mortals want their winter here 
No night is now with hymn or carol blest 
Therefore the moon  the governess of floods 
Pale in her anger  washes all the air 
That rheumatic diseases do abound 
And thorough this distemperature we see 
The seasons alter  hoaryheaded frosts 
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose 
And on old Hiems thin and icy crown 
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds 
Is  as in mockery  set  The spring  the summer 
The childing autumn  angry winter  change 
Their wonted liveries  and the mazed world 
By their increase  now knows not which is which 
And this same progeny of evil comes 
From our debate  from our dissension 
We are their parents and original 

Do you amend it then  it lies in you 
Why should Titania cross her Oberon 
I do but beg a little changeling boy 
To be my henchman 

Set your heart at rest 
The fairy land buys not the child of me 
His mother was a votaress of my order 
And  in the spiced Indian air  by night 
Full often hath she gossipd by my side 
And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands 
Marking the embarked traders on the flood 
When we have laughd to see the sails conceive 
And grow bigbellied with the wanton wind 
Which she  with pretty and with swimming gait 
Following her womb then rich with my young squire 
Would imitate  and sail upon the land 
To fetch me trifles  and return again 
As from a voyage  rich with merchandise 
But she  being mortal  of that boy did die 
And for her sake I do rear up her boy 
And for her sake I will not part with him 

How long within this wood intend you stay 

Perchance  till after Theseus weddingday 
If you will patiently dance in our round 
And see our moonlight revels  go with us 
If not  shun me  and I will spare your haunts 

Give me that boy  and I will go with thee 

Not for thy fairy kingdom  Fairies  away 
We shall chide downright  if I longer stay 


Well  go thy way  thou shalt not from this grove 
Till I torment thee for this injury 
My gentle Puck  come hither  Thou rememberst 
Since once I sat upon a promontory 
And heard a mermaid on a dolphins back 
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath 
That the rude sea grew civil at her song 
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres 
To hear the seamaids music 

I remember 

That very time I saw  but thou couldst not 
Flying between the cold moon and the earth 
Cupid all armd  a certain aim he took 
At a fair vestal throned by the west 
And loosd his loveshaft smartly from his bow 
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts 
But I might see young Cupids fiery shaft 
Quenchd in the chaste beams of the watry moon 
And the imperial votaress passed on 
In maiden meditation  fancyfree 
Yet markd I where the bolt of Cupid fell 
It fell upon a little western flower 
Before milkwhite  now purple with loves wound 
And maidens call it  Loveinidleness 
Fetch me that flower  the herb I showd thee once 
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid 
Will make or man or woman madly dote 
Upon the next live creature that it sees 
Fetch me this herb  and be thou here again 
Ere the leviathan can swim a league 

Ill put a girdle round about the earth 
In forty minutes 


Having once this juice 
Ill watch Titania when she is asleep 
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes 
The next thing then she waking looks upon 
Be it on lion  bear  or wolf  or bull 
On meddling monkey  or on busy ape 
She shall pursue it with the soul of love 
And ere I take this charm off from her sight 
As I can take it with another herb 
Ill make her render up her page to me 
But who comes here  I am invisible 
And I will overhear their conference 


I love thee not  therefore pursue me not 
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia 
The one Ill slay  the other slayeth me 
Thou toldst me they were stoln into this wood 
And here am I  and wood within this wood 
Because I cannot meet my Hermia 
Hence  get thee gone  and follow me no more 

You draw me  you hardhearted adamant 
But yet you draw not iron  for my heart 
Is true as steel  leave you your power to draw 
And I shall have no power to follow you 

Do I entice you  Do I speak you fair 
Or  rather  do I not in plainest truth 
Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you 

And even for that do I love you the more 
I am your spaniel  and  Demetrius 
The more you beat me  I will fawn on you 
Use me but as your spaniel  spurn me  strike me 
Neglect me  lose me  only give me leave 
Unworthy as I am  to follow you 
What worser place can I beg in your love 
And yet a place of high respect with me 
Than to be used as you use your dog 

Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit 
For I am sick when I do look on you 

And I am sick when I look not on you 

You do impeach your modesty too much 
To leave the city  and commit yourself 
Into the hands of one that loves you not 
To trust the opportunity of night 
And the ill counsel of a desert place 
With the rich worth of your virginity 

Your virtue is my privilege  for that 
It is not night when I do see your face 
Therefore I think I am not in the night 
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company 
For you in my respect are all the world 
Then how can it be said I am alone 
When all the world is here to look on me 

Ill run from thee and hide me in the brakes 
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts 

The wildest hath not such a heart as you 
Run when you will  the story shall be changd 
Apollo flies  and Daphne holds the chase 
The dove pursues the griffin  the mild hind 
Makes speed to catch the tiger  bootless speed 
When cowardice pursues and valour flies 

I will not stay thy questions  let me go 
Or  if thou follow me  do not believe 
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood 

Ay  in the temple  in the town  the field 
You do me mischief  Fie  Demetrius 
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex 
We cannot fight for love  as men may do 
We should be wood and were not made to woo 

Ill follow thee and make a heaven of hell 
To die upon the hand I love so well 


Fare thee well  nymph  ere he do leave this grove 
Thou shalt fly him  and he shall seek thy love 

Hast thou the flower there  Welcome  wanderer 

Ay  there it is 

I pray thee  give it me 
I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows 
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows 
Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine 
With sweet muskroses  and with eglantine 
There sleeps Titania some time of the night 
Lulld in these flowers with dances and delight 
And there the snake throws her enamelld skin 
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in 
And with the juice of this Ill streak her eyes 
And make her full of hateful fantasies 
Take thou some of it  and seek through this grove 
A sweet Athenian lady is in love 
With a disdainful youth  anoint his eyes 
But do it when the next thing he espies 
May be the lady  Thou shalt know the man 
By the Athenian garments he hath on 
Effect it with some care  that he may prove 
More fond on her than she upon her love 
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow 

Fear not  my lord  your servant shall do so 


Come  now a roundel and a fairy song 
Then  for the third of a minute  hence 
Some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds 
Some war with reremice for their leathern wings 
To make my small elves coats  and some keep back 
The clamorous owl  that nightly hoots  and wonders 
At our quaint spirits  Sing me now asleep 
Then to your offices  and let me rest 

The Fairies sing 


I 

You spotted snakes with double tongue 
Thorny hedgehogs  be not seen 
Newts  and blindworms  do no wrong 
Come not near our fairy queen 
Philomel  with melody 
Sing in our sweet lullaby 
Lulla  lulla  lullaby  lulla  lulla  lullaby 
Never harm 
Nor spell  nor charm 
Come our lovely lady nigh 
So  good night  with lullaby 

II 

Weaving spiders come not here 
Hence  you longleggd spinners  hence 
Beetles black  approach not near 
Worm nor snail  do no offence 
Philomel  with melody   c 


Hence  away  now all is well 
One aloof stand sentinel 

What thou seest when thou dost wake 
Do it for thy truelove take 
Love and languish for his sake 
Be it ounce  or cat  or bear 
Pard  or boar with bristled hair 
In thy eye that shall appear 
When thou wakst  it is thy dear 
Wake when some vile thing is near 

Fair love  you faint with wandering in the wood 
And to speak troth  I have forgot our way 
Well rest us  Hermia  if you think it good 
And tarry for the comfort of the day 

Be it so  Lysander  find you out a bed 
For I upon this bank will rest my head 

One turf shall serve as pillow for us both 
One heart  one bed  two bosoms  and one troth 

Nay  good Lysander  for my sake  my dear 
Lie further off yet  do not lie so near 

O  take the sense  sweet  of my innocence 
Love takes the meaning in loves conference 
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit 
So that but one heart we can make of it 
Two bosoms interchained with an oath 
So then two bosoms and a single troth 
Then by your side no bedroom me deny 
For  lying so  Hermia  I do not lie 

Lysander riddles very prettily 
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride 
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied 
But  gentle friend  for love and courtesy 
Lie further off  in human modesty 
Such separation as may well be said 
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid 
So far be distant  and  good night  sweet friend 
Thy love neer alter till thy sweet life end 

Amen  amen  to that fair prayer  say I 
And then end life when I end loyalty 

Here is my bed  sleep give thee all his rest 

With half that wish the wishers eyes be pressd 


Through the forest have I gone 
But Athenian found I none 
On whose eyes I might approve 
This flowers force in stirring love 
Night and silence  who is here 
Weeds of Athens he doth wear 
This is he  my master said 
Despised the Athenian maid 
And here the maiden  sleeping sound 
On the dank and dirty ground 
Pretty soul  she durst not lie 
Near this lacklove  this killcourtesy 

Churl  upon thy eyes I throw 
All the power this charm doth owe 
When thou wakst  let love forbid 
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid 
So awake when I am gone 
For I must now to Oberon 


Stay  though thou kill me  sweet Demetrius 

I charge thee  hence  and do not haunt me thus 

O  wilt thou darkling leave me  do not so 

Stay  on thy peril  I alone will go 


O  I am out of breath in this fond chase 
The more my prayer  the lesser is my grace 
Happy is Hermia  wheresoeer she lies 
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes 
How came her eyes so bright  Not with salt tears 
If so  my eyes are oftener washd than hers 
No  no  I am as ugly as a bear 
For beasts that meet me run away for fear 
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius 
Do  as a monster  fly my presence thus 
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine 
Made me compare with Hermias sphery eyne 
But who is here  Lysander  on the ground 
Dead  or asleep  I see no blood  no wound 
Lysander  if you live  good sir  awake 

And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake 
Transparent Helena  Nature shows art 
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart 
Where is Demetrius  O  how fit a word 
Is that vile name to perish on my sword 

Do not say so  Lysander  say not so 
What though he love your Hermia  Lord  what though 
Yet Hermia still loves you  then be content 

Content with Hermia  No  I do repent 
The tedious minutes I with her have spent 
Not Hermia  but Helena I love 
Who will not change a raven for a dove 
The will of man is by his reason swayd 
And reason says you are the worthier maid 
Things growing are not ripe until their season 
So I  being young  till now ripe not to reason 
And touching now the point of human skill 
Reason becomes the marshal to my will 
And leads me to your eyes  where I oerlook 
Loves stories written in loves richest book 

Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born 
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn 
Ist not enough  ist not enough  young man 
That I did never  no  nor never can 
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius eye 
But you must flout my insufficiency 
Good troth  you do me wrong  good sooth  you do 
In such disdainful manner me to woo 
But fare you well  perforce I must confess 
I thought you lord of more true gentleness 
O  that a lady of one man refusd 
Should of another therefore be abusd 


She sees not Hermia  Hermia  sleep thou there 
And never mayst thou come Lysander near 
For  as a surfeit of the sweetest things 
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings 
Or  as the heresies that men do leave 
Are hated most of those they did deceive 
So thou  my surfeit and my heresy 
Of all be hated  but the most of me 
And  all my powers  address your love and might 
To honour Helen  and to be her knight 


Help me  Lysander  help me  do thy best 
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast 
Ay me  for pity  what a dream was here 
Lysander  look how I do quake with fear 
Methought a serpent eat my heart away 
And you sat smiling at his cruel prey 
Lysander  what  removd Lysander  lord 
What  out of hearing  gone  no sound  no word 
Alack  where are you  speak  an if you hear 
Speak  of all loves  I swound almost with fear 
No  then I well perceive you are not nigh 
Either death or you Ill find immediately 

Are we all met 

Pat  pat  and heres a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal  This green plot shall be our stage  this hawthornbrake our tiringhouse  and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke 

Peter Quince 

What sayst thou  bully Bottom 

There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that will never please  First  Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself  which the ladies cannot abide  How answer you that 

Byr lakin  a parlous fear 

I believe we must leave the killing out  when all is done 

Not a whit  I have a device to make all well  Write me a prologue  and let the prologue seem to say  we will do no harm with our swords  and that Pyramus is not killed indeed  and  for the more better assurance  tell them that I  Pyramus  am not Pyramus  but Bottom the weaver  this will put them out of fear 

Well  we will have such a prologue  and it shall be written in eight and six 

No  make it two more  let it be written in eight and eight 

Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion 

I fear it  I promise you 

Masters  you ought to consider with yourselves  to bring in God shield us a lion among ladies  is a most dreadful thing  for there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living  and we ought to look to it 

Therefore  another prologue must tell he is not a lion 

Nay  you must name his name  and half his face must be seen through the lions neck  and he himself must speak through  saying thus  or to the same defect  Ladies  or  Fair ladies  I would wish you  or  I would request you  or  I would entreat you  not to fear  not to tremble  my life for yours  If you think I come hither as a lion  it were pity of my life  no  I am no such thing  I am a man as other men are  and there indeed let him name his name  and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner 

Well  it shall be so  But there is two hard things  that is  to bring the moonlight into a chamber  for  you know  Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight 

Doth the moon shine that night we play our play 

A calendar  a calendar  look in the almanack  find out moonshine  find out moonshine 

Yes  it doth shine that night 

Why  then may you leave a casement of the great chamberwindow  where we play  open  and the moon may shine in at the casement 

Ay  or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn  and say he comes to disfigure  or to present  the person of Moonshine  Then  there is another thing  we must have a wall in the great chamber  for Pyramus and Thisby  says the story  did talk through the chink of a wall 

You can never bring in a wall  What say you  Bottom 

Some man or other must present Wall  and let him have some plaster  or some loam  or some roughcast about him  to signify wall  and let him hold his fingers thus  and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper 

If that may be  than all is well  Come  sit down  every mothers son  and rehearse your parts  Pyramus  you begin  when you have spoken your speech  enter into that brake  and so every one according to his cue 


What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here 
So near the cradle of the fairy queen 
What  a play toward  Ill be an auditor 
An actor too perhaps  if I see cause 

Speak  Pyramus Thisby  stand forth 

Thisby  the flowers have odious savours sweet 

Odorous  odorous 

odours savours sweet 
So hath thy breath  my dearest Thisby dear  But hark  a voice  stay thou but here awhile 
And by and by I will to thee appear 


A stranger Pyramus than eer playd here 


Must I speak now 

Ay  marry  must you  for you must understand  he goes but to see a noise that he heard  and is to come again 

Most radiant Pyramus  most lilywhite of hue 
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier 
Most brisky juvenal  and eke most lovely Jew 
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire 
Ill meet thee  Pyramus  at Ninnys tomb 

Ninus tomb  man  Why  you must not speak that yet  that you answer to Pyramus  you speak all your part at once  cues and all  Pyramus  enter  your cue is past  it is never tire  

O As true as truest horse  that yet would never tire 


If I were  fair Thisby  I were only thine 

O monstrous  O strange  we are haunted 
Pray  masters  fly  masters Help 


Ill follow you  Ill lead you about a round 
Through bog  through bush  through brake  through brier 
Sometime a horse Ill be  sometime a hound 
A hog  a headless bear  sometime a fire 
And neigh  and bark  and grunt  and roar  and burn 
Like horse  hound  hog  bear  fire  at every turn 


Why do they run away  this is a knavery of them to make me afeard 


O Bottom  thou art changed  what do I see on thee 

What do you see  you see an asshead of your own  do you 

Bless thee  Bottom  bless thee  thou art translated 


I see their knavery  this is to make an ass of me  to fright me  if they could  But I will not stir from this place  do what they can  I will walk up and down here  and I will sing  that they shall hear I am not afraid 

The ouselcock  so black of hue 
With orangetawny bill 
The throstle with his note so true 
The wren with little quill 


What angel wakes me from my flowery bed 


The finch  the sparrow  and the lark 
The plainsong cuckoo gray 
Whose note full many a man doth mark 
And dares not answer  nay 

for indeed  who would set his wit to so foolish a bird  who would give a bird the lie  though he cry cuckoo never so 

I pray thee  gentle mortal  sing again 
Mine ear is much enamourd of thy note 
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape 
And thy fair virtues force  perforce  doth move me 
On the first view  to say  to swear  I love thee 

Methinks  mistress  you should have little reason for that  and yet  to say the truth  reason and love keep little company together nowadays  The more the pity  that some honest neighbours will not make them friends  Nay  I can gleek upon occasion 

Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful 

Not so  neither  but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood  I have enough to serve mine own turn 

Out of this wood do not desire to go 
Thou shalt remain here  wher thou wilt or no 
I am a spirit of no common rate 
The summer still doth tend upon my state 
And I do love thee  therefore  go with me 
Ill give thee fairies to attend on thee 
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep 
And sing  while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep 
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so 
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go 
Peaseblossom  Cobweb  Moth  and Mustardseed 


Ready 

And I 

And I 

And I 

Where shall we go 

Be kind and courteous to this gentleman 
Hop in his walks  and gambol in his eyes 
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries 
With purple grapes  green figs  and mulberries 
The honeybags steal from the humblebees 
And for nighttapers crop their waxen thighs 
And light them at the fiery glowworms eyes 
To have my love to bed  and to arise 
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies 
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes 
Nod to him  elves  and do him courtesies 

Hail  mortal 

Hail 

Hail 

Hail 

I cry your worships mercy  heartily  I beseech your worships name 

Cobweb 

I shall desire you of more acquaintance  good Master Cobweb  if I out my finger  I shall make bold with you  Your name  honest gentleman 

Peaseblossom 

I pray you  commend me to Mistress Squash  your mother  and to Master Peascod  your father  Good Master Peaseblossom  I shall desire you of more acquaintance too  Your name  I beseech you  sir 

Mustardseed 

Good Master Mustardseed  I know your patience well  that same cowardly  giantlike oxbeef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house  I promise you  your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now  I desire you of more acquaintance  good Master Mustardseed 

Come  wait upon him  lead him to my bower 
The moon methinks  looks with a watery eye 
And when she weeps  weeps every little flower 
Lamenting some enforced chastity 
Tie up my loves tongue  bring him silently 


I wonder if Titania be awakd 
Then  what it was that next came in her eye 
Which she must dote on in extremity 
Here comes my messenger 


How now  mad spirit 

What nightrule now about this haunted grove 

My mistress with a monster is in love 
Near to her close and consecrated bower 
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour 
A crew of patches  rude mechanicals 
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls 
Were met together to rehearse a play 
Intended for great Theseus nuptial day 
The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort 
Who Pyramus presented in their sport 
Forsook his scene  and enterd in a brake 
When I did him at this advantage take 
An asss nowl I fixed on his head 
Anon his Thisbe must be answered 
And forth my mimick comes  When they him spy 
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye 
Or russetpated choughs  many in sort 
Rising and cawing at the guns report 
Sever themselves  and madly sweep the sky 
So  at his sight  away his fellows fly 
And  at our stamp  here oer and oer one falls 
He murder cries  and help from Athens calls 
Their sense thus weak  lost with their fears thus strong 
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong 
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch 
Some sleeves  some hats  from yielders all things catch 
I led them on in this distracted fear 
And left sweet Pyramus translated there 
When in that moment  so it came to pass 
Titania wakd and straightway lovd an ass 

This falls out better than I could devise 
But hast thou yet latchd the Athenians eyes 
With the lovejuice  as I did bid thee do 

I took him sleeping that is finishd too 
And the Athenian woman by his side 
That  when he wakd  of force she must be eyd 


Stand close  this is the same Athenian 

This is the woman  but not this the man 

O  why rebuke you him that loves you so 
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe 

Now I but chide  but I should use thee worse 
For thou  I fear  hast given me cause to curse 
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep 
Being oer shoes in blood  plunge in knee deep 
And kill me too 
The sun was not so true unto the day 
As he to me  Would he have stoln away 
From sleeping Hermia  Ill believe as soon 
This whole earth may be bord  and that the moon 
May through the centre creep  and so displease 
Her brothers noontide with the Antipodes 
It cannot be but thou hast murderd him 
So should a murderer look  so dead  so grim 

So should the murderd look  and so should I 
Piercd through the heart with your stern cruelty 
Yet you  the murderer  look as bright  as clear 
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere 

Whats this to my Lysander  where is he 
Ah  good Demetrius  wilt thou give him me 

I had rather give his carcass to my hounds 

Out  dog  out  cur  thou drivst me past the bounds 
Of maidens patience  Hast thou slain him then 
Henceforth be never numberd among men 
O  once tell true  tell true  een for my sake 
Durst thou have lookd upon him being awake 
And hast thou killd him sleeping  O brave touch 
Could not a worm  an adder  do so much 
An adder did it  for with doubler tongue 
Than thine  thou serpent  never adder stung 

You spend your passion on a misprisd mood 
I am not guilty of Lysanders blood 
Nor is he dead  for aught that I can tell 

I pray thee  tell me then that he is well 

An if I could  what should I get therefore 

A privilege never to see me more 
And from thy hated presence part I so 
See me no more  wher he be dead or no 


There is no following her in this fierce vein 
Here therefore for awhile I will remain 
So sorrows heaviness doth heavier grow 
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe 
Which now in some slight measure it will pay 
If for his tender here I make some stay 


What hast thou done  thou hast mistaken quite 
And laid the lovejuice on some trueloves sight 
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue 
Some truelove turnd  and not a false turnd true 

Then fate oerrules  that  one man holding troth 
A million fail  confounding oath on oath 

About the wood go swifter than the wind 
And Helena of Athens look thou find 
All fancysick she is  and pale of cheer 
With sighs of love  that cost the fresh blood dear 
By some illusion see thou bring her here 
Ill charm his eyes against she do appear 

I go  I go  look how I go 
Swifter than arrow from the Tartars bow 

Flower of this purple dye 
Hit with Cupids archery 
Sink in apple of his eye 
When his love he doth espy 
Let her shine as gloriously 
As the Venus of the sky 
When thou wakst  if she be by 
Beg of her for remedy 


Captain of our fairy band 
Helena is here at hand 
And the youth  mistook by me 
Pleading for a lovers fee 
Shall we their fond pageant see 
Lord  what fools these mortals be 

Stand aside  the noise they make 
Will cause Demetrius to awake 

Then will two at once woo one 
That must needs be sport alone 
And those things do best please me 
That befall preposterously 

Why should you think that I should woo in scorn 
Scorn and derision never come in tears 
Look  when I vow  I weep  and vows so born 
In their nativity all truth appears 
How can these things in me seem scorn to you 
Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true 

You do advance your cunning more and more 
When truth kills truth  O devilishholy fray 
These vows are Hermias  will you give her oer 
Weigh oath with oath  and you will nothing weigh 
Your vows  to her and me  put in two scales 
Will even weigh  and both as light as tales 

I had no judgment when to her I swore 

Nor none  in my mind  now you give her oer 

Demetrius loves her  and he loves not you 

O Helen  goddess  nymph  perfect  divine 
To what  my love  shall I compare thine eyne 
Crystal is muddy  O  how ripe in show 
Thy lips  those kissing cherries  tempting grow 
This pure congealed white  high Taurus snow 
Fannd with the eastern wind  turns to a crow 
When thou holdst up thy hand  O  let me kiss 
That princess of pure white  this seal of bliss 

O spite  O hell  I see you all are bent 
To set against me for your merriment 
If you were civil and knew courtesy 
You would not do me thus much injury 
Can you not hate me  as I know you do 
But you must join in souls to mock me too 
If you were men  as men you are in show 
You would not use a gentle lady so 
To vow  and swear  and superpraise my parts 
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts 
You both are rivals  and love Hermia 
And now both rivals  to mock Helena 
A trim exploit  a manly enterprise 
To conjure tears up in a poor maids eyes 
With your derision  none of noble sort 
Would so offend a virgin  and extort 
A poor souls patience  all to make you sport 

You are unkind  Demetrius  be not so 
For you love Hermia  this you know I know 
And here  with all good will  with all my heart 
In Hermias love I yield you up my part 
And yours of Helena to me bequeath 
Whom I do love  and will do to my death 

Never did mockers waste more idle breath 

Lysander  keep thy Hermia  I will none 
If eer I lovd her  all that love is gone 
My heart with her but as guest wise sojournd 
And now to Helen it is home returnd 
There to remain 

Helen  it is not so 

Disparage not the faith thou dost not know 
Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear 
Look  where thy love comes  yonder is thy dear 


Dark night  that from the eye his function takes 
The ear more quick of apprehension makes 
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense 
It pays the hearing double recompense 
Thou art not by mine eye  Lysander  found 
Mine ear  I thank it  brought me to thy sound 
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so 

Why should he stay  whom love doth press to go 

What love could press Lysander from my side 

Lysanders love  that would not let him bide 
Fair Helena  who more engilds the night 
Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light 
Why seekst thou me  could not this make thee know 
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so 

You speak not as you think  it cannot be 

Lo  she is one of this confederacy 
Now I perceive they have conjoind all three 
To fashion this false sport in spite of me 
Injurious Hermia  most ungrateful maid 
Have you conspird  have you with these contrivd 
To bait me with this foul derision 
Is all the counsel that we two have shard 
The sistervows  the hours that we have spent 
When we have chid the hastyfooted time 
For parting us  O  is it all forgot 
All schooldays friendship  childhood innocence 
We  Hermia  like two artificial gods 
Have with our neelds created both one flower 
Both on one sampler  sitting on one cushion 
Both warbling of one song  both in one key 
As if our hands  our sides  voices  and minds 
Had been incorporate  So we grew together 
Like to a double cherry  seeming parted 
But yet an union in partition 
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem 
So  with two seeming bodies  but one heart 
Two of the first  like coats in heraldry 
Due but to one  and crowned with one crest 
And will you rent our ancient love asunder 
To join with men in scorning your poor friend 
It is not friendly  tis not maidenly 
Our sex  as well as I  may chide you for it 
Though I alone do feel the injury 

I am amazed at your passionate words 
I scorn you not  it seems that you scorn me 

Have you not set Lysander  as in scorn 
To follow me and praise my eyes and face 
And made your other love  Demetrius 
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot 
To call me goddess  nymph  divine and rare 
Precious  celestial  Wherefore speaks he this 
To her he hates  and wherefore doth Lysander 
Deny your love  so rich within his soul 
And tender me  forsooth  affection 
But by your setting on  by your consent 
What though I be not so in grace as you 
So hung upon with love  so fortunate 
But miserable most to love unlovd 
This you should pity rather than despise 

I understand not what you mean by this 

Ay  do  persever  counterfeit sad looks 
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back 
Wink each at other  hold the sweet jest up 
This sport  well carried  shall be chronicled 
If you have any pity  grace  or manners 
You would not make me such an argument 
But  fare ye well  tis partly mine own fault 
Which death or absence soon shall remedy 

Stay  gentle Helena  hear my excuse 
My love  my life  my soul  fair Helena 

O excellent 

Sweet  do not scorn her so 

If she cannot entreat  I can compel 

Thou canst compel no more than she entreat 
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers 
Helen  I love thee  by my life  I do 
I swear by that which I will lose for thee 
To prove him false that says I love thee not 

I say I love thee more than he can do 

If thou say so  withdraw  and prove it too 

Quick  come 

Lysander  whereto tends all this 

Away  you Ethiop 

No  no  hell      
Seem to break loose  take on  as you would follow 
But yet come not  you are a tame man  go 

Hang off  thou cat  thou burr  vile thing  let loose 
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent 

Why are you grown so rude  what change is this 
Sweet love 

Thy love  out  tawny Tartar  out 
Out  loathed medicine  hated poison  hence 

Do you not jest 

Yes  sooth  and so do you 

Demetrius  I will keep my word with thee 

I would I had your bond  for I perceive 
A weak bond holds you  Ill not trust your word 

What  should I hurt her  strike her  kill her dead 
Although I hate her  Ill not harm her so 

What  can you do me greater harm than hate 
Hate me  wherefore  O me  what news  my love 
Am not I Hermia  Are not you Lysander 
I am as fair now as I was erewhile 
Since night you lovd me  yet  since night you left me 
Why  then you left me O  the gods forbid 
In earnest  shall I say 

Ay  by my life 
And never did desire to see thee more 
Therefore be out of hope  of question  doubt 
Be certain  nothing truer  tis no jest 
That I do hate thee and love Helena 

O me  you juggler  you cankerblossom 
You thief of love  what  have you come by night 
And stoln my loves heart from him 

Fine  i faith 
Have you no modesty  no maiden shame 
No touch of bashfulness  What  will you tear 
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue 
Fie  fie  you counterfeit  you puppet you 

Puppet  why  so  ay  that way goes the game 
Now I perceive that she hath made compare 
Between our statures  she hath urgd her height 
And with her personage  her tall personage 
Her height  forsooth  she hath prevaild with him 
And are you grown so high in his esteem 
Because I am so dwarfish and so low 
How low am I  thou painted maypole  speak 
How low am I  I am not yet so low 
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes 

I pray you  though you mock me  gentlemen 
Let her not hurt me  I was never curst 
I have no gift at all in shrewishness 
I am a right maid for my cowardice 
Let her not strike me  You perhaps may think 
Because she is something lower than myself 
That I can match her 

Lower  hark  again 

Good Hermia  do not be so bitter with me 
I evermore did love you  Hermia 
Did ever keep your counsels  never wrongd you 
Save that  in love unto Demetrius 
I told him of your stealth unto this wood 
He followd you  for love I followd him 
But he hath chid me hence  and threatend me 
To strike me  spurn me  nay  to kill me too 
And now  so you will let me quiet go 
To Athens will I bear my folly back 
And follow you no further  let me go 
You see how simple and how fond I am 

Why  get you gone  Who ist that hinders you 

A foolish heart  that I leave here behind 

What  with Lysander 

With Demetrius 

Be not afraid  she shall not harm thee  Helena 

No  sir  she shall not  though you take her part 

O  when shes angry  she is keen and shrewd 
She was a vixen when she went to school 
And though she be but little  she is fierce 

Little again  nothing but low and little  
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus 
Let me come to her 

Get you gone  you dwarf 
You minimus  of hindering knotgrass made 
You bead  you acorn 

You are too officious 
In her behalf that scorns your services 
Let her alone  speak not of Helena 
Take not her part  for  if thou dost intend 
Never so little show of love to her 
Thou shalt aby it 

Now she holds me not 
Now follow  if thou darst  to try whose right 
Or thine or mine  is most in Helena 

Follow  nay  Ill go with thee  cheek by jole 


You  mistress  all this coil is long of you 
Nay  go not back 

I will not trust you  I 
Nor longer stay in your curst company 
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray 
My legs are longer though  to run away 


I am amazd  and know not what to say 


This is thy negligence  still thou mistakst 
Or else commitst thy knaveries wilfully 

Believe me  king of shadows  I mistook 
Did not you tell me I should know the man 
By the Athenian garments he had on 
And so far blameless proves my enterprise 
That I have nointed an Athenians eyes 
And so far am I glad it so did sort 
As this their jangling I esteem a sport 

Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight 
Hie therefore  Robin  overcast the night 
The starry welking cover thou anon 
With drooping fog as black as Acheron 
And lead these testy rivals so astray 
As one come not within anothers way 
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue 
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong 
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius 
And from each other look thou lead them thus 
Till oer their brows deathcounterfeiting sleep 
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep 
Then crush this herb into Lysanders eye 
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property 
To take from thence all error with his might 
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight 
When they next wake  all this derision 
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision 
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend 
With league whose date till death shall never end 
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ 
Ill to my queen and beg her Indian boy 
And then I will her charmed eye release 
From monsters view  and all things shall be peace 

My fairy lord  this must be done with haste 
For nights swift dragons cut the clouds full fast 
And yonder shines Auroras harbinger 
At whose approach  ghosts  wandering here and there 
Troop home to churchyards  damned spirits all 
That in crossways and floods have burial 
Already to their wormy beds are gone 
For fear lest day should look their shames upon 
They wilfully themselves exile from light 
And must for aye consort with blackbrowd night 

But we are spirits of another sort 
I with the mornings love have oft made sport 
And  like a forester  the groves may tread 
Even till the eastern gate  all fieryred 
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams 
Turns into yellow gold his salt greenstreams 
But  notwithstanding  haste  make no delay 
We may effect this business yet ere day 

Up and down  up and down 
I will lead them up and down 
I am feard in field and town 
Goblin  lead them up and down 

Here comes one 


Where art thou  proud Demetrius  speak thou now 

Here  villain  drawn and ready  Where art thou 

I will be with thee straight 

Follow me  then 
To plainer ground 

Lysander  speak again 
Thou runaway  thou coward  art thou fled 
Speak  In some bush  Where dost thou hide thy head 

Thou coward  art thou bragging to the stars 
Telling the bushes that thou lookst for wars 
And wilt not come  Come  recreant  come  thou child 
Ill whip thee with a rod  he is defild 
That draws a sword on thee 

Yea  art thou there 

Follow my voice  well try no manhood here 

He goes before me and still dares me on 
When I come where he calls  then he is gone 
The villain is much lighterheeld than I 
I followd fast  but faster he did fly 
That fallen am I in dark uneven way 
And here will rest me 

Come  thou gentle day 
For if but once thou show me thy grey light 
Ill find Demetrius and revenge this spite 

Ho  ho  ho  Coward  why comst thou not 

Abide me  if thou darst  for well I wot 
Thou runnst before me  shifting every place 
And darst not stand  nor look me in the face 
Where art thou now 

Come hither  I am here 

Nay then  thou mockst me  Thou shalt buy this dear 
If ever I thy face by daylight see 
Now  go thy way  Faintness constraineth me 
To measure out my length on this cold bed 
By days approach look to be visited 

O weary night  O long and tedious night 
Abate thy hours  shine  comforts  from the east 
That I may back to Athens by daylight 
From these that my poor company detest 
And sleep  that sometimes shuts up sorrows eye 
Steal me awhile from mine own company 

Yet but three  Come one more 
Two of both kinds make up four 
Here she comes  curst and sad 
Cupid is a knavish lad 
Thus to make poor females mad 

Never so weary  never so in woe 
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers 
I can no further crawl  no further go 
My legs can keep no pace with my desires 
Here will I rest me till the break of day 
Heavens shield Lysander  if they mean a fray 

On the ground 
Sleep sound 
Ill apply 
To your eye 
Gentle lover  remedy 

When thou wakst 
Thou takst 
True delight 
In the sight 
Of thy former ladys eye 
And the country proverb known 
That every man should take his own 
In your waking shall be shown 
Jack shall have Jill 
Nought shall go ill 
The man shall have his mare again 
And all shall be well 


Come  sit thee down upon this flowery bed 
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy 
And stick muskroses in thy sleek smooth head 
And kiss thy fair large ears  my gentle joy 

Wheres Peaseblossom

What  wilt thou hear some music  my sweet love 

I have a reasonable good ear in music  let us have the tongs and the bones 

Or say  sweet love  what thou desirst to eat 

Truly  a peck of provender  I could munch your good dry oats  Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay  good hay  sweet hay  hath no fellow 

I have a venturous fairy that shall seek 
The squirrels hoard  and fetch thee thence new nuts 

I had rather have a handful or two of dried pease  But  I pray you  let none of your people stir me  I have an exposition of sleep come upon me 

Sleep thou  and I will wind thee in my arms 
Fairies  be gone  and be all ways away 

So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle 
Gently entwist  the female ivy so 
Enrings the barky fingers of the elm 
O  how I love thee  how I dote on thee 

Welcome  good Robin  Seest thou this sweet sight 
Her dotage now I do begin to pity 
For  meeting her of late behind the wood 
Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool 
I did upbraid her and fall out with her 
For she his hairy temples then had rounded 
With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers 
And that same dew  which sometime on the buds 
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls 
Stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes 
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail 
When I had at my pleasure taunted her 
And she in mild terms beggd my patience 
I then did ask of her her changeling child 
Which straight she gave me  and her fairy sent 
To bear him to my bower in fairy land 
And now I have the boy  I will undo 
This hateful imperfection of her eyes 
And  gentle Puck  take this transformed scalp 
From off the head of this Athenian swain 
That he  awaking when the other do 
May all to Athens back again repair 
And think no more of this nights accidents 
But as the fierce vexation of a dream 
But first I will release the fairy queen 


Be as thou wast wont to be 
See as thou wast wont to see 
Dians bud oer Cupids flower 
Hath such force and blessed power 

Now  my Titania  wake you  my sweet queen 

My Oberon  what visions have I seen 
Methought I was enamourd of an ass 

There lies your love 

How came these things to pass 
O  how mine eyes do loathe his visage now 

Silence  awhile  Robin  take off this head 
Titania  music call  and strike more dead 
Than common sleep of all these five the sense 

Music  ho  music  such as charmeth sleep 


When thou wakst  with thine own fools eyes peep 

Sound  music 

Come  my queen  take hands with me 
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be 
Now thou and I are new in amity 
And will tomorrow midnight solemnly 
Dance in Duke Theseus house triumphantly 
And bless it to all fair prosperity 
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be 
Wedded  with Theseus  all in jollity 


Fairy king  attend  and mark 
I do hear the morning lark 

Then  my queen  in silence sad 
Trip we after the nights shade 
We the globe can compass soon 
Swifter than the wandering moon 

Come  my lord  and in our flight 
Tell me how it came this night 
That I sleeping here was found 
With these mortals on the ground 


Go  one of you  find out the forester 
For now our observation is performd 
And since we have the vaward of the day 
My love shall hear the music of my hounds 
Uncouple in the western valley  let them go 
Dispatch  I say  and find the forester 
We will  fair queen  up to the mountains top 
And mark the musical confusion 
Of hounds and echo in conjunction 

I was with Hercules and Cadmus once 
When in a wood of Crete they bayd the bear 
With hounds of Sparta  never did I hear 
Such gallant chiding  for  besides the groves 
The skies  the fountains  every region near 
Seemd all one mutual cry  I never heard 
So musical a discord  such sweet thunder 

My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind 
So flewd  so sanded  and their heads are hung 
With ears that sweep away the morning dew 
Crookkneed  and dewlappd like Thessalian bulls 
Slow in pursuit  but matchd in mouth like bells 
Each under each  A cry more tuneable 
Was never hollad to  nor cheerd with horn 
In Crete  in Sparta  nor in Thessaly 
Judge  when you hear  But  soft  what nymphs are these 

My lord  this is my daughter here asleep 
And this  Lysander  this Demetrius is 
This Helena  old Nedars Helena 
I wonder of their being here together 

No doubt they rose up early to observe 
The rite of May  and  hearing our intent 
Came here in grace of our solemnity 
But speak  Egeus  is not this the day 
That Hermia should give answer of her choice 

It is  my lord 

Go  bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns 


Good morrow  friends  Saint Valentine is past 

Begin these woodbirds but to couple now 

Pardon  my lord 


I pray you all  stand up 
I know you two are rival enemies 
How comes this gentle concord in the world 
That hatred is so far from jealousy 
To sleep by hate  and fear no enmity 

My lord  I shall reply amazedly 
Half sleep  half waking  but as yet  I swear 
I cannot truly say how I came here 
But  as I think for truly would I speak 
And now I do bethink me  so it is 
I came with Hermia hither  our intent 
Was to be gone from Athens  where we might 
Without the peril of the Athenian law 

Enough  enough  my lord  you have enough 
I beg the law  the law  upon his head 
They would have stoln away  they would  Demetrius 
Thereby to have defeated you and me 
You of your wife  and me of my consent 
Of my consent that she should be your wife 

My lord  fair Helen told me of their stealth 
Of this their purpose hither  to this wood 
And I in fury hither followd them 
Fair Helena in fancy following me 
But  my good lord  I wot not by what power 
But by some power it is my love to Hermia 
Melted as doth the snow  seems to me now 
As the remembrance of an idle gaud 
Which in my childhood I did dote upon 
And all the faith  the virtue of my heart 
The object and the pleasure of mine eye 
Is only Helena  To her  my lord 
Was I betrothd ere I saw Hermia 
But  like in sickness  did I loathe this food 
But  as in health  come to my natural taste 
Now do I wish it  love it  long for it 
And will for evermore be true to it 

Fair lovers  you are fortunately met 
Of this discourse we more will hear anon 
Egeus  I will overbear your will 
For in the temple  by and by  with us 
These couples shall eternally be knit 
And  for the morning now is something worn 
Our purposd hunting shall be set aside 
Away with us  to Athens  three and three 
Well hold a feast in great solemnity 
Come  Hippolyta 


These things seem small and undistinguishable 
Like faroff mountains turned into clouds 

Methinks I see these things with parted eye 
When everything seems double 

So methinks 
And I have found Demetrius  like a jewel 
Mine own  and not mine own 

Are you sure 
That we are awake  It seems to me 
That yet we sleep  we dream  Do you not think 
The duke was here  and bid us follow him 

Yea  and my father 

And Hippolyta 

And he did bid us follow to the temple 

Why then  we are awake  Lets follow him 
And by the way let us recount our dreams 


When my cue comes  call me  and I will answer  my next is  Most fair Pyramus  Heighho  Peter Quince  Flute  the bellowsmender  Snout  the tinker  Starveling  Gods my life  stolen hence  and left me asleep  I have had a most rare vision  I have had a dream  past the wit of man to say what dream it was  man is but an ass  if he go about to expound this dream  Methought I was there is no man can tell what  Methought I was and methought I had but man is but a patched fool  if he will offer to say what methought I had  The eye of man hath not heard  the ear of man hath not seen  mans hand is not able to taste  his tongue to conceive  nor his heart to report  what my dream was  I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream  it shall be called Bottoms Dream  because it hath no bottom  and I will sing it in the latter end of a play  before the duke  peradventure  to make it the more gracious  I shall sing it at her death 


Have you sent to Bottoms house  is he come home yet 

He cannot be heard of  Out of doubt he is transported 

If he come not  then the play is marred  it goes not forward  doth it 

It is not possible  you have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he 

No  he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens 

Yea  and the best person too  and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice 

You must say  paragon  a paramour is  God bless us  a thing of naught 


Masters  the duke is coming from the temple  and there is two or three lords and ladies more married  if our sport had gone forward  we had all been made men 

O sweet bully Bottom  Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life  he could not have scaped sixpence a day  an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus  Ill be hanged  he would have deserved it  sixpence a day in Pyramus  or nothing 


Where are these lads  where are these hearts 

Bottom  O most courageous day  O most happy hour 

Masters  I am to discourse wonders  but ask me not what  for if I tell you  I am no true Athenian  I will tell you everything  right as it fell out 

Let us hear  sweet Bottom 

Not a word of me  All that I will tell you is  that the duke hath dined  Get your apparel together  good strings to your beards  new ribbons to your pumps  meet presently at the palace  every man look oer his part  for the short and the long is  our play is preferred  In any case  let Thisby have clean linen  and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails  for they shall hang out for the lions claws  And  most dear actors  eat no onions nor garlic  for we are to utter sweet breath  and I do not doubt but to hear them say  it is a sweet comedy  No more words  away  go  away 

Tis strange  my Theseus  that these lovers speak of 

More strange than true  I never may believe 
These antique fables  nor these fairy toys 
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains 
Such shaping fantasies  that apprehend 
More than cool reason ever comprehends 
The lunatic  the lover  and the poet 
Are of imagination all compact 
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold 
That is  the madman  the lover  all as frantic 
Sees Helens beauty in a brow of Egypt 
The poets eye  in a fine frenzy rolling 
Doth glance from heaven to earth  from earth to heaven 
And  as imagination bodies forth 
The forms of things unknown  the poets pen 
Turns them to shapes  and gives to airy nothing 
A local habitation and a name 
Such tricks hath strong imagination 
That  if it would but apprehend some joy 
It comprehends some bringer of that joy 
Or in the night  imagining some fear 
How easy is a bush supposd a bear 

But all the story of the night told over 
And all their minds transfigurd so together 
More witnesseth than fancys images 
And grows to something of great constancy 
But  howsoever  strange and admirable 

Here come the lovers  full of joy and mirth 


Joy  gentle friends  joy  and fresh days of love 

Accompany your hearts 

More than to us 
Wait in your royal walks  your board  your bed 

Come now  what masques  what dances shall we have 
To wear away this long age of three hours 
Between our aftersupper and bedtime 
Where is our usual manager of mirth 
What revels are in hand  Is there no play 
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour 
Call Philostrate 

Here  mighty Theseus 

Say  what abridgment have you for this evening 
What masque  what music  How shall we beguile 
The lazy time  if not with some delight 

There is a brief how many sports are ripe 
Make choice of which your highness will see first 


The battle with the Centaurs  to be sung 
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp 
Well none of that  that have I told my love 
In glory of my kinsman Hercules 
The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals 
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage 
That is an old device  and it was playd 
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror 
The thrice three Muses mourning for the death 
Of Learning  late deceasd in beggary 
That is some satire keen and critical 
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony 
A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus 
And his love Thisbe  very tragical mirth 
Merry and tragical  tedious and brief 
That is  hot ice and wonderous strange snow 
How shall we find the concord of this discord 

A play there is  my lord  some ten words long 
Which is as brief as I have known a play 
But by ten words  my lord  it is too long 
Which makes it tedious  for in all the play 
There is not one word apt  one player fitted 
And tragical  my noble lord  it is 
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself 
Which when I saw rehearsd  I must confess 
Made mine eyes water  but more merry tears 
The passion of loud laughter never shed 

What are they that do play it 

Hardhanded men  that work in Athens here 
Which never labourd in their minds till now 
And now have toild their unbreathd memories 
With this same play  against your nuptial 

And we will hear it 

No  my noble lord 
It is not for you  I have heard it over 
And it is nothing  nothing in the world 
Unless you can find sport in their intents 
Extremely stretchd and connd with cruel pain 
To do you service 

I will hear that play 
For never anything can be amiss 
When simpleness and duty tender it 
Go  bring them in  and take your places  ladies 


I love not to see wretchedness oerchargd 
And duty in his service perishing 

Why  gentle sweet  you shall see no such thing 

He says they can do nothing in this kind 

The kinder we  to give them thanks for nothing 
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake 
And what poor duty cannot do  noble respect 
Takes it in might  not merit 
Where I have come  great clerks have purposed 
To greet me with premeditated welcomes 
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale 
Make periods in the midst of sentences 
Throttle their practisd accent in their fears 
And  in conclusion  dumbly have broke off 
Not paying me a welcome  Trust me  sweet 
Out of this silence yet I pickd a welcome 
And in the modesty of fearful duty 
I read as much as from the rattling tongue 
Of saucy and audacious eloquence 
Love  therefore  and tonguetied simplicity 
In least speak most  to my capacity 


So please your Grace  the Prologue is addressd 

Let him approach 


If we offend  it is with our good will 
That you should think  we come not to offend 
But with good will  To show our simple skill 
That is the true beginning of our end 
Consider then we come but in despite 
We do not come as minding to content you 
Our true intent is  All for your delight 
We are not here  That you should here repent you 
The actors are at hand  and  by their show 
You shall know all that you are like to know 


This fellow doth not stand upon points 

He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt  he knows not the stop  A good moral  my lord  it is not enough to speak  but to speak true 

Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder  a sound  but not in government 

His speech was like a tangled chain  nothing impaired  but all disordered  Who is next 


Gentles  perchance you wonder at this show 
But wonder on  till truth make all things plain 
This man is Pyramus  if you would know 
This beauteous lady Thisby is  certain 
This man  with lime and roughcast  doth present 
Wall  that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder 
And through Walls chink  poor souls  they are content 
To whisper  at the which let no man wonder 
This man  with lanthorn  dog  and bush of thorn 
Presenteth Moonshine  for  if you will know 
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn 
To meet at Ninus tomb  there  there to woo 
This grisly beast  which Lion hight by name 
The trusty Thisby  coming first by night 
Did scare away  or rather did affright 
And  as she fied  her mantle she did fall 
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain 
Anon comes Pyramus  sweet youth and tall 
And finds his trusty Thisbys mantle slain 
Whereat  with blade  with bloody blameful blade 
He bravely broachd his boiling bloody breast 
And Thisby  tarrying in mulberry shade 
His dagger drew  and died  For all the rest 
Let Lion  Moonshine  Wall  and lovers twain 
At large discourse  while here they do remain 


I wonder  if the lion be to speak 

No wonder  my lord  one lion may  when many asses do 
Wall  In this same interlude it doth befall 
That I  one Snout by name  present a wall 
And such a wall  as I would have you think 
That had in it a crannied hole or chink 
Through which the lovers  Pyramus and Thisby 
Did whisper often very secretly 
This loam  this roughcast  and this stone doth show 
That I am that same wall  the truth is so 
And this the cranny is  right and sinister 
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper 

Would you desire lime and hair to speak better 

It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse  my lord 

Pyramus draws near the wall  silence 


O grimlookd night  O night with hue so black 
O night  which ever art when day is not 
O night  O night  alack  alack  alack 
I fear my Thisbys promise is forgot 
And thou  O wall  O sweet  O lovely wall 
That standst between her fathers ground and mine 
Thou wall  O wall  O sweet  and lovely wall 
Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne 

Thanks  courteous wall  Jove shield thee well for this 
But what see I  No Thisby do I see 
O wicked wall  through whom I see no bliss 
Cursd be thy stones for thus deceiving me 

The wall  methinks  being sensible  should curse again 

No  in truth  sir  he should not  Deceiving me  is Thisbys cue  she is to enter now  and I am to spy her through the wall  You shall see  it will fall pat as I told you  Yonder she comes 


O wall  full often hast thou heard my moans 
For parting my fair Pyramus and me 
My cherry lips have often kissd thy stones 
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee 

I see a voice  now will I to the chink 
To spy an I can hear my Thisbys face 
Thisby 

My love  thou art my love  I think 

Think what thou wilt  I am thy lovers grace 
And  like Limander  am I trusty still 

And I like Helen  till the Fates me kill 

Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true 

As Shafalus to Procrus  I to you 

O  kiss me through the hole of this vile wall 

I kiss the walls hole  not your lips at all 

Wilt thou at Ninnys tomb meet me straightway 

Tide life  tide death  I come without delay 


Thus have I  Wall  my part discharged so 
And  being done  thus Wall away doth go 


Now is the mural down between the two neighbours 

No remedy  my lord  when walls are so wilful to hear without warning 

This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard 

The best in this kind are but shadows  and the worst are no worse  if imagination amend them 

It must be your imagination then  and not theirs 

If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves  they may pass for excellent men  Here come two noble beasts in  a man and a lion 


You  ladies  you  whose gentle hearts do fear 
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor 
May now perchance both quake and tremble here 
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar 
Then know that I  one Snug the joiner  am 
A lionfell  nor else no lions dam 
For  if I should as lion come in strife 
Into this place  twere pity on my life 

A very gentle beast  and of a good conscience 

The very best at a beast  my lord  that eer I saw 

This lion is a very fox for his valour 

True  and a goose for his discretion 

Not so  my lord  for his valour cannot carry his discretion  and the fox carries the goose 

His discretion  I am sure  cannot carry his valour  for the goose carries not the fox  It is well  leave it to his discretion  and let us listen to the moon 

This lanthorn doth the horned moon present 

He should have worn the horns on his head 

He is no crescent  and his horns are invisible within the circumference 

This lanthorn doth the horned moon present 
Myself the man i the moon do seem to be 

This is the greatest error of all the rest 
The man should be put into the lanthorn  how is it else the man i the moon 

He dares not come there for the candle  for  you see  it is already in snuff 

I am aweary of this moon  would he would change 

It appears  by his small light of discretion  that he is in the wane  but yet  in courtesy  in all reason  we must stay the time 

Proceed  Moon 

All that I have to say  is  to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon  I  the man in the moon  this thornbush  my thornbush  and this dog  my dog 

Why  all these should be in the lanthorn  for all these are in the moon  But  silence  here comes Thisbe 


This is old Ninnys tomb  Where is my love 

Oh 


Well roared  Lion 

Well run  Thisbe 

Well shone  Moon  Truly  the moon shines with a good grace 


Well moused  Lion 

And then came Pyramus 

And so the lion vanished 


Sweet moon  I thank thee for thy sunny beams 
I thank thee  moon  for shining now so bright 
For  by thy gracious  golden  glittering streams 
I trust to taste of truest Thisbys sight 

But stay  O spite 
But mark  poor knight 
What dreadful dole is here 
Eyes  do you see 
How can it be 
O dainty duck  O dear 
Thy mantle good 
What  staind with blood 
Approach  ye Furies fell 
O Fates  come  come 
Cut thread and thrum 
Quail  crush  conclude  and quell 


This passion  and the death of a dear friend  would go near to make a man look sad 

Beshrew my heart  but I pity the man 

O  wherefore  Nature  didst thou lions frame 
Since lion vile hath here deflowerd my dear 
Which is no  no which was the fairest dame 
That livd  that lovd  that likd  that lookd with cheer 


Come tears  confound 
Out  sword  and wound 
The pap of Pyramus 
Ay  that left pap 
Where heart doth hop 
Thus die I  thus  thus  thus 

Now am I dead 
Now am I fled 
My soul is in the sky 
Tongue  lose thy light 
Moon  take thy flight 

Now die  die  die  die  die 

No die  but an ace  for him  for he is but one 

Less than an ace  man  for he is dead  he is nothing 

With the help of a surgeon  he might yet recover  and prove an ass 

How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover 

She will find him by starlight  Here she comes  and her passion ends the play 


Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus  I hope she will be brief 

A mote will turn the balance  which Pyramus  which Thisbe  is the better  he for a man  God warrant us  she for a woman  God bless us 

She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes 

And thus she moans  videlicet 


Asleep  my love 
What  dead  my dove 
O Pyramus  arise 
Speak  speak  Quite dumb 
Dead  dead  A tomb 
Must cover thy sweet eyes 
These lily lips 
This cherry nose 
These yellow cowslip cheeks 
Are gone  are gone 
Lovers  make moan 
His eyes were green as leeks 
O  Sisters Three 
Come  come to me 
With hands as pale as milk 
Lay them in gore 
Since you have shore 
With shears his thread of silk 
Tongue  not a word 
Come  trusty sword 
Come  blade  my breast imbrue 

And farewell  friends 
Thus Thisby ends 
Adieu  adieu  adieu 

Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead 

Ay  and Wall too 

No  I assure you  the wall is down that parted their fathers  Will it please you to see the epilogue  or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company 

No epilogue  I pray you  for your play needs no excuse  Never excuse  for when the players are all dead  there need none to be blamed  Marry  if he that writ it had played Pyramus  and hanged himself in Thisbes garter  it would have been a fine tragedy  and so it is  truly  and very notably discharged  But come  your Bergomask  let your epilogue alone 

The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve 
Lovers  to bed  tis almost fairy time 
I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn 
As much as we this night have overwatchd 
This palpablegross play hath well beguild 
The heavy gait of night  Sweet friends  to bed 
A fortnight hold we this solemnity 
In nightly revels  and new jollity 

Now the hungry lion roars 
And the wolf behowls the moon 
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores 
All with weary task fordone 
Now the wasted brands do glow 
Whilst the screechowl  screeching loud 
Puts the wretch that lies in woe 
In remembrance of a shroud 
Now it is the time of night 
That the graves  all gaping wide 
Every one lets forth his sprite 
In the churchway paths to glide 
And we fairies  that do run 
By the triple Hecates team 
From the presence of the sun 
Following darkness like a dream 
Now are frolic  not a mouse 
Shall disturb this hallowd house 
I am sent with broom before 
To sweep the dust behind the door 


Through the house give glimmering light 
By the dead and drowsy fire 
Every elf and fairy sprite 
Hop as light as bird from brier 
And this ditty after me 
Sing and dance it trippingly 

First  rehearse your song by rote 
To each word a warbling note 
Hand in hand  with fairy grace 
Will we sing  and bless this place 


Now  until the break of day 
Through this house each fairy stray 
To the best bridebed will we 
Which by us shall blessed be 
And the issue there create 
Ever shall be fortunate 
So shall all the couples three 
Ever true in loving be 
And the blots of Natures hand 
Shall not in their issue stand 
Never mole  harelip  nor scar 
Nor mark prodigious  such as are 
Despised in nativity 
Shall upon their children be 
With this fielddew consecrate 
Every fairy take his gait 
And each several chamber bless 
Through this palace  with sweet peace 
Ever shall in safety rest 
And the owner of it blest 
Trip away 
Make no stay 
Meet me all by break of day 


If we shadows have offended 
Think but this  and all is mended 
That you have but slumberd here 
While these visions did appear 
And this weak and idle theme 
No more yielding but a dream 
Gentles  do not reprehend 
If you pardon  we will mend 
And  as Im an honest Puck 
If we have unearned luck 
Now to scape the serpents tongue 
We will make amends ere long 
Else the Puck a liar call 
So  good night unto you all 
Give me your hands  if we be friends 
And Robin shall restore amends
