ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL

In delivering my son from me  I bury a second husband 

And I  in going  madam  weep oer my fathers death anew  but I must attend his majestys command  to whom I am now in ward  evermore in subjection 

You shall find of the king a husband  madam  you  sir  a father  He that so generally is at all times good  must of necessity hold his virtue to you  whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance 

What hope is there of his majestys amendment 

He hath abandoned his physicians  madam  under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope  and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time 

This young gentlewoman had a father O  that had  how sad a passage tis whose skill was almost as great as his honesty  had it stretched so far  would have made nature immortal  and death should have play for lack of work  Would  for the kings sake  he were living  I think it would be the death of the kings disease 

How called you the man you speak of  madam 

He was famous  sir  in his profession  and it was his great right to be so  Gerard de Narbon 

He was excellent indeed  madam  the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly  He was skilful enough to have lived still  if knowledge could be set up against mortality 

What is it  my good lord  the king languishes of 

A fistula  my lord 

I heard not of it before 

I would it were not notorious  Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon 

His sole child  my lord  and bequeathed to my overlooking  I have those hopes of her good that her education promises  her dispositions she inherits  which makes fair gifts fairer  for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities  there commendations go with pity  they are virtues and traitors too  in her they are the better for their simpleness  she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness 

Your commendations  madam  get from her tears 

Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in  The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek  No more of this  Helena  go to  no more  lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow  than have it 

I do affect a sorrow indeed  but I have it too 

Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead  excessive grief the enemy to the living 

If the living be enemy to the grief  the excess makes it soon mortal 

Madam  I desire your holy wishes 

How understand we that 

Be thou blest  Bertram  and succeed thy father 
In manners  as in shape  thy blood and virtue 
Contend for empire in thee  and thy goodness 
Share with thy birthright  Love all  trust a few 
Do wrong to none  be able for thine enemy 
Rather in power than use  and keep thy friend 
Under thy own lifes key  be checkd for silence 
But never taxd for speech  What heaven more will 
That thee may furnish  and my prayers pluck down 
Fall on thy head  Farewell  my lord 
Tis an unseasond courtier  good my lord 
Advise him 

He cannot want the best 
That shall attend his love 

Heaven bless him  Farewell  Bertram 


The best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you  Be comfortable to my mother  your mistress  and make much of her 

Farewell  pretty lady  you must hold the credit of your father 


O  were that all  I think not on my father 
And these great tears grace his remembrance more 
Than those I shed for him  What was he like 
I have forgot him  my imagination 
Carries no favour int but Bertrams 
I am undone  there is no living  none 
If Bertram be away  It were all one 
That I should love a bright particular star 
And think to wed it  he is so above me 
In his bright radiance and collateral light 
Must I be comforted  not in his sphere 
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself 
The hind that would be mated by the lion 
Must die for love  Twas pretty  though a plague 
To see him every hour  to sit and draw 
His arched brows  his hawking eye  his curls 
In our hearts table  heart too capable 
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour 
But now hes gone  and my idolatrous fancy 
Must sanctify his reliques  Who comes here 
One that goes with him  I love him for his sake 
And yet I know him a notorious liar 
Think him a great way fool  solely a coward 
Yet these fixd evils sit so fit in him 
That they take place  when virtues steely bones 
Look bleak in the cold wind  withal  full oft we see 
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly 


Save you  fair queen 

And you  monarch 

No 

And no 

Are you meditating on virginity 

Ay  You have some stain of soldier in you  let me ask you a question  Man is enemy to virginity  how may we barricado it against him 

Keep him out 

But he assails  and our virginity  though valiant in the defence  yet is weak  Unfold to us some warlike resistance 

There is none  man  sitting down before you  will undermine you and blow you up 

Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up  Is there no military policy  how virgins might blow up men 

Virginity being blown down  man will quicklier be blown up  marry in blowing him down again  with the breach yourselves made  you lose your city  It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity  Loss of virginity is rational increase  and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost  That you were made of is metal to make virgins  Virginity  by being once lost  may be ten times found  by being ever kept  it is ever lost Tis too cold a companion  away witht 

I will stand fort a little  though therefore I die a virgin 

Theres little can be said int  tis against the rule of nature  To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers  which is most infallible disobedience  He that hangs himself is a virgin  virginity murders itself  and should be buried in highways  out of all sanctified limit  as a desperate offendress against nature  Virginity breeds mites  much like a cheese  consumes itself to the very paring  and so dies with feeding his own stomach  Besides  virginity is peevish  proud  idle  made of selflove  which is the most inhibited sin in the canon  Keep it not  you cannot choose but lose byt  Out witht  within the year it will make itself two  which is a goodly increase  and the principal itself not much the worse  Away witht 

How might one do  sir  to lose it to her own liking 

Let me see  marry  ill  to like him that neer it likes  Tis a commodity that will lose the gloss with lying  the longer kept  the less worth  off witht  while tis vendible  answer the time of request  Virginity  like an old courtier  wears her cap out of fashion  richly suited  but unsuitable  just like the brooch and the toothpick  which wear not now  Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek  and your virginity  your old virginity  is like one of our French withered pears  it looks ill  it eats drily  marry  tis a withered pear  it was formerly better  marry  yet tis a withered pear  Will you anything with it 

Not my virginity yet 
There shall your master have a thousand loves 
A mother  and a mistress  and a friend 
A ph nix  captain  and an enemy 
A guide  a goddess  and a sovereign 
A counsellor  a traitress  and a dear 
His humble ambition  proud humility 
His jarring concord  and his discord dulcet 
His faith  his sweet disaster  with a world 
Of pretty  fond  adoptious christendoms 
That blinking Cupid gossips  Now shall he 
I know not what he shall  God send him well 
The courts a learningplace  and he is one 

What one  i faith 

That I wish well  Tis pity 

Whats pity 

That wishing well had not a body int 
Which might be felt  that we  the poorer born 
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes 
Might with effects of them follow our friends 
And show what we alone must think  which never 
Returns us thanks 


Monsieur Parolles  my lord calls for you 


Little Helen  farewell  if I can remember thee  I will think of thee at court 

Monsieur Parolles  you were born under a charitable star 

Under Mars  I 

I especially think  under Mars 

Why under Mars 

The wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars 

When he was predominant 

When he was retrograde  I think rather 

Why think you so 

You go so much backward when you fight 

Thats for advantage 

So is running away  when fear proposes the safety  but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing  and I like the wear well 

I am so full of businesses I cannot answer thee acutely  I will return perfect courtier  in the which  my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee  so thou wilt be capable of a courtiers counsel  and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee  else thou diest in thine unthankfulness  and thine ignorance makes thee away  farewell  When thou hast leisure  say thy prayers  when thou hast none  remember thy friends  Get thee a good husband  and use him as he uses thee  so  farewell 


Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie 
Which we ascribe to heaven  the fated sky 
Gives us free scope  only doth backward pull 
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull 
What power is it which mounts my love so high 
That makes me see  and cannot feed mine eye 
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings 
To join like likes  and kiss like native things 
Impossible be strange attempts to those 
That weigh their pains in sense  and do suppose 
What hath been cannot be  who ever strove 
To show her merit  that did miss her love 
The kings disease my project may deceive me 
But my intents are fixd and will not leave me 


The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears 
Have fought with equal fortune  and continue 
A braving war 

So tis reported  sir 

Nay  tis most credible  we here receive it 
A certainty  vouchd from our cousin Austria 
With caution that the Florentine will move us 
For speedy aid  wherein our dearest friend 
Prejudicates the business  and would seem 
To have us make denial 

His love and wisdom 
Approvd so to your majesty  may plead 
For amplest credence 

He hath armd our answer 
And Florence is denied before he comes 
Yet  for our gentlemen that mean to see 
The Tuscan service  freely have they leave 
To stand on either part 

It well may serve 
A nursery to our gentry  who are sick 
For breathing and exploit 

Whats he comes here 


It is the Count Rousillon  my good lord 
Young Betram 

Youth  thou bearst thy fathers face 
Frank nature  rather curious than in haste 
Hath well composd thee  Thy fathers moral parts 
Mayst thou inherit too  Welcome to Paris 

My thanks and duty are your majestys 

I would I had that corporal soundness now 
As when thy father and myself in friendship 
First tried our soldiership  He did look far 
Into the service of the time and was 
Discipled of the bravest  he lasted long 
But on us both did haggish age steal on 
And wore us out of act  It much repairs me 
To talk of your good father  In his youth 
He had the wit which I can well observe 
Today in our young lords  but they may jest 
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted 
Ere they can hide their levity in honour 
So like a courtier  contempt nor bitterness 
Were in his pride or sharpness  if they were 
His equal had awakd them  and his honour 
Clock to itself  knew the true minute when 
Exception bid him speak  and at this time 
His tongue obeyd his hand  who were below him 
He usd as creatures of another place 
And bowd his eminent top to their low ranks 
Making them proud of his humility 
In their poor praise he humbled  Such a man 
Might be a copy to these younger times 
Which  followd well  would demonstrate them now 
But goers backward 

His good remembrance  sir 
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb 
So in approof lives not his epitaph 
As in your royal speech 

Would I were with him  He would always say 
Methinks I hear him now  his plausive words 
He scatterd not in ears  but grafted them 
To grow there and to bear  Let me not live  
Thus his good melancholy oft began 
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime 
When it was out Let me not live  quoth he 
After my flame lacks oil  to be the snuff 
Of younger spirits  whose apprehensive senses 
All but new things disdain  whose judgments are 
Mere fathers of their garments  whose constancies 
Expire before their fashions  This he wishd 
I  after him  do after him wish too 
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home 
I quickly were dissolved from my hive 
To give some labourers room 

You are lovd  sir 
They that least lend it you shall lack you first 

I fill a place  I knowt  How long ist  count 
Since the physician at your fathers died 
He was much famd 

Some six months since  my lord 

If he were living  I would try him yet 
Lend me an arm  the rest have worn me out 
With several applications  nature and sickness 
Debate it at their leisure  Welcome  count 
My sons no dearer 

Thank your majesty 


I will now hear  what say you of this gentlewoman 

Madam  the care I have had to even your content  I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours  for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings  when of ourselves we publish them 

What does this knave here  Get you gone  sirrah  the complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe  tis my slowness that I do not  for I know you lack not folly to commit them  and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours 

Tis not unknown to you  madam  I am a poor fellow 

Well  sir 

No  madam  tis not so well that I am poor  though many of the rich are damned  But  if I may have your ladyships good will to go to the world  Isbel the woman and I will do as we may 

Wilt thou needs be a beggar 

I do beg your good will in this case 

In what case 

In Isbels case and mine own  Service is no heritage  and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o my body  for they say barnes are blessings 

Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry 

My poor body  madam  requires it  I am driven on by the flesh  and he must needs go that the devil drives 

Is this all your worships reason 

Faith  madam  I have other holy reasons  such as they are 

May the world know them 

I have been  madam  a wicked creature  as you and all flesh and blood are  and  indeed  I do marry that I may repent 

Thy marriage  sooner than thy wickedness 

I am out o friends  madam  and I hope to have friends for my wifes sake 

Such friends are thine enemies  knave 

Youre shallow  madam  in great friends  for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of  He that ears my land spares my team  and gives me leave to in the crop  if I be his cuckold  hes my drudge  He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood  he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood  he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend  ergo  he that kisses my wife is my friend  If men could be contented to be what they are  there were no fear in marriage  for young Charbon the puritan  and old Poysam the papist  howsomeer their hearts are severed in religion  their heads are both one  they may joul horns together like any deer i the herd 

Wilt thou ever be a foulmouthed and calumnious knave 

A prophet I  madam  and I speak the truth the next way 

For I the ballad will repeat 
Which men full true shall find 
Your marriage comes by destiny 
Your cuckoo sings by kind 


Get you gone  sir  Ill talk with you more anon 

May it please you  madam  that he bid Helen come to you  of her I am to speak 

Sirrah  tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her  Helen I mean 


Was this fair face the cause  quoth she 
Why the Grecians sacked Troy 
Fond done  done fond 
Was this King Priams joy 
With that she sighed as she stood 
With that she sighed as she stood 
And gave this sentence then 
Among nine bad if one be good 
Among nine bad if one be good 
Theres yet one good in ten 


What  one good in ten  you corrupt the song  sirrah 

One good woman in ten  madam  which is a purifying o the song  Would God would serve the world so all the year  wed find no fault with the tithewoman if I were the parson  One in ten  quoth a  An we might have a good woman born but for every blazing star  or at an earthquake twould mend the lottery well  a man may draw his heart out ere a pluck one 

Youll be gone  sir knave  and do as I command you 

That man should be at womans command  and yet no hurt done  Though honesty be no puritan  yet it will do no hurt  it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart  I am going  forsooth  the business is for Helen to come hither 


Well  now 

I know  madam  you love your gentlewoman entirely 

Faith  I do  her father bequeathed her to me  and she herself  without other advantage  may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds  there is more owing her than is paid  and more shall be paid her than shell demand 

Madam  I was very late more near her than I think she wished me  alone she was  and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears  she thought  I dare vow for her  they touched not any stranger sense  Her matter was  she loved your son  Fortune  she said  was no goddess  that had put such difference betwixt their two estates  Love no god  that would not extend his might  only where qualities were level  Dian no queen of virgins  that would suffer her poor knight surprised  without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward  This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that eer I heard virgin exclaim in  which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal  sithence in the loss that may happen  it concerns you something to know it 

You have discharged this honestly  keep it to yourself  Many likelihoods informed me of this before  which hung so tottering in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt  Pray you  leave me  stall this in your bosom  and I thank you for your honest care  I will speak with you further anon 

Even so it was with me when I was young 
If ever we are natures  these are ours  this thorn 
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong 
Our blood to us  this to our blood is born 
It is the show and seal of natures truth 
Where loves strong passion is impressd in youth 
By our remembrances of days foregone 
Such were our faults  or then we thought them none 

Her eye is sick ont  I observe her now 

What is your pleasure  madam 

You know  Helen 
I am a mother to you 

Mine honourable mistress 

Nay  a mother 
Why not a mother  When I said  a mother  
Methought you saw a serpent  whats in mother 
That you start at it  I say  I am your mother 
And put you in the catalogue of those 
That were enwombed mine  tis often seen 
Adoption strives with nature  and choice breeds 
A native slip to us from foreign seeds 
You neer oppressd me with a mothers groan 
Yet I express to you a mothers care 
Gods mercy  maiden  does it curd thy blood 
To say I am thy mother  Whats the matter 
That this distemperd messenger of wet 
The manycolourd Iris  rounds thine eye 
Why  that you are my daughter 

That I am not 

I say  I am your mother 

Pardon  madam 
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother 
I am from humble  he from honourd name 
No note upon my parents  his all noble 
My master  my dear lord he is  and I 
His servant live  and will his vassal die 
He must not be my brother 

Nor I your mother 

You are my mother  madam  would you were 
So that my lord your son were not my brother 
Indeed my mother  or were you both our mothers 
I care no more for than I do for heaven 
So I were not his sister  Cant no other 
But  I your daughter  he must be my brother 

Yes  Helen  you might be my daughterinlaw 
God shield you mean it not  daughter and mother 
So strive upon your pulse  What  pale again 
My fear hath catchd your fondness  now I see 
The mystery of your loneliness  and find 
Your salt tears head  now to all sense tis gross 
You love my son  invention is ashamd 
Against the proclamation of thy passion 
To say thou dost not  therefore tell me true 
But tell me then  tis so  for  look  thy cheeks 
Confess it  th one to th other  and thine eyes 
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours 
That in their kind they speak it  only sin 
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue 
That truth should be suspected  Speak  ist so 
If it be so  you have wound a goodly clew 
If it be not  forsweart  howeer  I charge thee 
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail 
To tell me truly 

Good madam  pardon me 

Do you love my son 

Your pardon  noble mistress 

Love you my son 

Do not you love him  madam 

Go not about  my love hath int a bond 
Whereof the world takes note  come  come  disclose 
The state of your affection  for your passions 
Have to the full appeachd 

Then  I confess 
Here on my knee  before high heaven and you 
That before you  and next unto high heaven 
I love your son 
My friends were poor  but honest  sos my love 
Be not offended  for it hurts not him 
That he is lovd of me  I follow him not 
By any token of presumptuous suit 
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him 
Yet never know how that desert should be 
I know I love in vain  strive against hope 
Yet  in this captious and intenible sieve 
I still pour in the waters of my love 
And lack not to lose still  Thus  Indianlike 
Religious in mine error  I adore 
The sun  that looks upon his worshipper 
But knows of him no more  My dearest madam 
Let not your hate encounter with my love 
For loving where you do  but  if yourself 
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth 
Did ever in so true a flame of liking 
Wish chastely and love dearly  that your Dian 
Was both herself and Love  O  then  give pity 
To her  whose state is such that cannot choose 
But lend and give where she is sure to lose 
That seeks not to find that her search implies 
But  riddlelike  lives sweetly where she dies 

Had you not lately an intent  speak truly 
To go to Paris 

Madam  I had 

Wherefore  tell true 

I will tell truth  by grace itself I swear 
You know my father left me some prescriptions 
Of rare and provd effects  such as his reading 
And manifest experience had collected 
For general sovereignty  and that he willd me 
In heedfullst reservation to bestow them 
As notes whose faculties inclusive were 
More than they were in note  Amongst the rest 
There is a remedy  approvd  set down 
To cure the desperate languishings whereof 
The king is renderd lost 

This was your motive 
For Paris  was it  speak 

My lord your son made me to think of this 
Else Paris  and the medicine  and the king 
Had from the conversation of my thoughts 
Haply been absent then 

But think you  Helen 
If you should tender your supposed aid 
He would receive it  He and his physicians 
Are of a mind  he  that they cannot help him 
They  that they cannot help  How shall they credit 
A poor unlearned virgin  when the schools 
Embowelld of their doctrine  have left off 
The danger to itself 

Theres something int 
More than my fathers skill  which was the greatst 
Of his profession  that his good receipt 
Shall for my legacy be sanctified 
By the luckiest stars in heaven  and  would your honour 
But give me leave to try success  Id venture 
The welllost life of mine on his Graces cure 
By such a day  and hour 

Dost thou believet 

Ay  madam  knowingly 

Why  Helen  thou shalt have my leave and love 
Means  and attendants  and my loving greetings 
To those of mine in court  Ill stay at home 
And pray Gods blessing into thy attempt 
Be gone tomorrow  and be sure of this 
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss 


Farewell  young lords  these warlike principles 
Do not throw from you  and you  my lords  farewell 
Share the advice betwixt you  if both gain  all 
The gift doth stretch itself as tis receivd 
And is enough for both 

Tis our hope  sir 
After well enterd soldiers  to return 
And find your Grace in health 

No  no  it cannot be  and yet my heart 
Will not confess he owes the malady 
That doth my life besiege  Farewell  young lords 
Whether I live or die  be you the sons 
Of worthy Frenchmen  let higher Italy 
Those bated that inherit but the fall 
Of the last monarchy see that you come 
Not to woo honour  but to wed it  when 
The bravest questant shrinks  find what you seek 
That fame may cry you loud  I say  farewell 

Health  at your bidding  serve your majesty 

Those girls of Italy  take heed of them 
They say  our French lack language to deny 
If they demand  beware of being captives 
Before you serve 

Our hearts receive your warnings 

Farewell  Come hither to me 


O my sweet lord  that you will stay behind us 

Tis not his fault  the spark 

O  tis brave wars 

Most admirable  I have seen those wars 

I am commanded here  and kept a coil with 
Too young  and the next year  and tis too early  

An thy mind stand tot  boy  steal away bravely 

I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock 
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry 
Till honour be bought up and no sword worn 
But one to dance with  By heaven  Ill steal away 

Theres honour in the theft 

Commit it  count 

I am your accessary  and so farewell 

I grow to you  and our parting is a tortured body 

Farewell  captain 

Sweet Monsieur Parolles 

Noble heroes  my sword and yours are kin  Good sparks and lustrous  a word  good metals  you shall find in the regiment of the Spinii  one Captain Spurio  with his cicatrice  an emblem of war  here on his sinister cheek  it was this very sword entrenched it  say to him  I live  and observe his reports for me 

We shall  noble captain 


Mars dote on you for his novices  What will ye do 

Stay  the king 


Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords  you have restrained yourself within the list of too cold an adieu  be more expressive to them  for they wear themselves in the cap of the time  there do muster true gait  eat  speak  and move under the influence of the most received star  and though the devil lead the measure  such are to be followed  After them  and take a more dilated farewell 

And I will do so 

Worthy fellows  and like to prove most sinewy swordmen 

Pardon  my lord  for me and for my tidings 

Ill fee thee to stand up 

Then heres a man stands that has brought his pardon 
I would you had kneeld  my lord  to ask me mercy 
And that at my bidding you could so stand up 

I would I had  so I had broke thy pate 
And askd thee mercy fort 

Good faith  across  but  my good lord  tis thus 
Will you be curd of your infirmity 

No 

O  will you eat no grapes  my royal fox 
Yes  but you will my noble grapes an if 
My royal fox could reach them  I have seen a medicine 
Thats able to breathe life into a stone 
Quicken a rock  and make you dance canary 
With spritely fire and motion  whose simple touch 
Is powerful to araise King Pepin  nay 
To give great Charlemain a pen ins hand 
And write to her a loveline 

What her is this 

Why  Doctor She  My lord  theres one arrivd 
If you will see her  now  by my faith and honour 
If seriously I may convey my thoughts 
In this my light deliverance  I have spoke 
With one  that in her sex  her years  profession 
Wisdom  and constancy  hath amazd me more 
Than I dare blame my weakness  Will you see her 
For that is her demand  and know her business 
That done  laugh well at me 

Now  good Lafeu 
Bring in the admiration  that we with thee 
May spend our wonder too  or take off thine 
By wondring how thou tookst it 

Nay  Ill fit you 
And not be all day neither 


Thus he his special nothing ever prologues 


Nay  come your ways 

This haste hath wings indeed 

Nay  come your ways 
This is his majesty  say your mind to him 
A traitor you do look like  but such traitors 
His majesty seldom fears  I am Cressids uncle 
That dare leave two together  Fare you well 


Now  fair one  does your business follow us 

Ay  my good lord 
Gerard de Narbon was my father 
In what he did profess well found 

I knew him 

The rather will I spare my praises towards him 
Knowing him is enough  Ons bed of death 
Many receipts he gave me  chiefly one 
Which  as the dearest issue of his practice 
And of his old experience the only darling 
He bade me store up as a triple eye 
Safer than mine own two  more dear  I have so 
And  hearing your high majesty is touchd 
With that malignant cause wherein the honour 
Of my dear fathers gift stands chief in power 
I come to tender it and my appliance 
With all bound humbleness 

We thank you  maiden 
But may not be so credulous of cure 
When our most learned doctors leave us  and 
The congregated college have concluded 
That labouring art can never ransom nature 
From her inaidable estate  I say we must not 
So stain our judgment  or corrupt our hope 
To prostitute our pastcure malady 
To empirics  or to dissever so 
Our great self and our credit  to esteem 
A senseless help when help past sense we deem 

My duty then  shall pay me for my pains 
I will no more enforce mine office on you 
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts 
A modest one  to bear me back again 

I cannot give thee less  to be calld grateful 
Thou thoughtst to help me  and such thanks I give 
As one near death to those that wish him live 
But what at full I know  thou knowst no part 
I knowing all my peril  thou no art 

What I can do can do no hurt to try 
Since you set up your rest gainst remedy 
He that of greatest works is finisher 
Oft does them by the weakest minister 
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown 
When judges have been babes  great floods have flown 
From simple sources  and great seas have dried 
When miracles have by the greatest been denied 
Oft expectation fails  and most oft there 
Where most it promises  and oft it hits 
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits 

I must not hear thee  fare thee well  kind maid 
Thy pains  not usd  must by thyself be paid 
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward 

Inspired merit so by breath is barrd 
It is not so with Him that all things knows 
As tis with us that square our guess by shows 
But most it is presumption in us when 
The help of heaven we count the act of men 
Dear sir  to my endeavours give consent 
Of heaven  not me  make an experiment 
I am not an impostor that proclaim 
Myself against the level of mine aim 
But know I think  and think I know most sure 
My art is not past power nor you past cure 

Art thou so confident  Within what space 
Hopst thou my cure 

The greatst grace lending grace 
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring 
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring 
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp 
Moist Hesperus hath quenchd his sleepy lamp 
Or four and twenty times the pilots glass 
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass 
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly 
Health shall live free  and sickness freely die 

Upon thy certainty and confidence 
What darst thou venture 

Tax of impudence 
A strumpets boldness  a divulged shame 
Traducd by odious ballads  my maidens name 
Seard otherwise  nay worse if worse extended 
With vilest torture let my life be ended 

Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak 
His powerful sound within an organ weak 
And what impossibility would slay 
In common sense  sense saves another way 
Thy life is dear  for all that life can rate 
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate 
Youth  beauty  wisdom  courage  virtue  all 
That happiness and prime can happy call 
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate 
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate 
Sweet practiser  thy physic I will try 
That ministers thine own death if I die 

If I break time  or flinch in property 
Of what I spoke  unpitied let me die 
And well deservd  Not helping  deaths my fee 
But  if I help  what do you promise me 

Make thy demand 

But will you make it even 

Ay  by my sceptre  and my hopes of heaven 

Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand 
What husband in thy power I will command 
Exempted be from me the arrogance 
To choose from forth the royal blood of France 
My low and humble name to propagate 
With any branch or image of thy state 
But such a one  thy vassal  whom I know 
Is free for me to ask  thee to bestow 

Here is my hand  the premises observd 
Thy will by my performance shall be servd 
So make the choice of thy own time  for I 
Thy resolvd patient  on thee still rely 
More should I question thee  and more I must 
Though more to know could not be more to trust 
From whence thou camst  how tended on  but rest 
Unquestiond welcome and undoubted blest 
Give me some help here  ho  If thou proceed 
As high as word  my deed shall match thy deed 


Come on  sir  I shall now put you to the height of your breeding 

I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught  I know my business is but to the court 

To the court  why what place make you special  when you put off that with such contempt  But to the court  

Truly  madam  if God have lent a man any manners  he may easily put it off at court  he that cannot make a leg  put offs cap  kiss his hand  and say nothing  has neither leg  hands  lip  nor cap  and indeed such a fellow  to say precisely  were not for the court  But  for me  I have an answer will serve all men 

Marry  thats a bountiful answer that fits all questions 

It is like a barbers chair that fits all buttocks  the pinbuttock  the quatchbuttock  the brawnbuttock  or any buttock 

Will your answer serve fit to all questions 

As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney  as your French crown for your taffeta punk  as Tibs rush for Toms forefinger  as a pancake for ShroveTuesday  a morris for Mayday  as the nail to his hole  the cuckold to his horn  as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave  as the nuns lip to the friars mouth  nay  as the pudding to his skin 

Have you  I say  an answer of such fitness for all questions 

From below your duke to beneath your constable  it will fit any question 

It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands 

But a trifle neither  in good faith  if the learned should speak truth of it  Here it is  and all that belongs tot  ask me if I am a courtier  it shall do you no harm to learn 

To be young again  if we could  I will be a fool in question  hoping to be the wiser by your answer  I pray you  sir  are you a courtier 

O Lord  sir  theres a simple putting off  More  more  a hundred of them 

Sir  I am a poor friend of yours  that loves you 

O Lord  sir  Thick  thick  spare not me 

I think  sir  you can eat none of this homely meat 

O Lord  sir  Nay  put me tot  I warrant you 

You were lately whipped  sir  as I think 

O Lord  sir  Spare not me 

Do you cry  O Lord  sir  at your whipping  and Spare not me  Indeed your O Lord  sir  is very sequent to your whipping  you would answer very well to a whipping  if you were but bound tot 

I neer had worse luck in my life in my O Lord  sir  I see things may serve long  but not serve ever 

I play the noble housewife with the time 
To entertaint so merrily with a fool 

O Lord  sir  why  theret serves well again 

An end  sir  to your business  Give Helen this 
And urge her to a present answer back 
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son 
This is not much 

Not much commendation to them 

Not much employment for you  you understand me 

Most fruitfully  I am there before my legs 

Haste you again 


They say miracles are past  and we have our philosophical persons  to make modern and familiar  things supernatural and causeless  Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors  ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge  when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear 

Why  tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times 

And so tis 

To be relinquished of the artists 

So I say 

Both of Galen and Paracelsus 

So I say 

Of all the learned and authentic fellows 

Right  so I say 

That gave him out incurable 

Why  there tis  so say I too 

Not to be helped 

Right  as twere  a man assured of a 

Uncertain life  and sure death 

Just  you say well  so would I have said 

I may truly say it is a novelty to the world 

It is  indeed  if you will have it in showing  you shall read it in what do you call there 

A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor 

Thats it I would have said  the very same 

Why  your dolphin is not lustier  fore me  I speak in respect 

Nay  tis strange  tis very strange  that is the brief and the tedious of it  and he is of a most facinorous spirit  that will not acknowledge it to be the 

Very hand of heaven 

Ay  so I say 

In a most weak and debile minister  great power  great transcendence  which should  indeed  give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the king  as to be generally thankful 

I would have said it  you say well  Here comes the king 


Lustig  as the Dutchman says  Ill like a maid the better  whilst I have a tooth in my head  Why  hes able to lead her a coranto 

Mort du vinaigre  Is not this Helen 

Fore God  I think so 

Go  call before me all the lords in court 

Sit  my preserver  by thy patients side 
And with this healthful hand  whose banishd sense 
Thou hast repeald  a second time receive 
The confirmation of my promised gift 
Which but attends thy naming 


Fair maid  send forth thine eye  this youthful parcel 
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing 
Oer whom both sovreign power and fathers voice 
I have to use  thy frank election make 

Thou hast power to choose  and they none to forsake 

To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress 
Fall  when Love please  marry  to each  but one 

Id give bay Curtal  and his furniture 
My mouth no more were broken than these boys 
And writ as little beard 

Peruse them well 
Not one of those but had a noble father 

Gentlemen 
Heaven hath through me restord the king to health 

We understand it  and thank heaven for you 

I am a simple maid  and therein wealthiest 
That I protest I simply am a maid 
Please it your majesty  I have done already 
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me 
We blush  that thou shouldst choose  but  be refusd 
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever 
Well neer come there again  

Make choice  and see 
Who shuns thy love  shuns all his love in me 

Now  Dian  from thy altar do I fly 
And to imperial Love  that god most high 
Do my sighs stream  Sir  will you hear my suit 

And grant it 

Thanks  sir  all the rest is mute 

I had rather be in this choice than throw amesace for my life 

The honour  sir  that flames in your fair eyes 
Before I speak  too threateningly replies 
Love make your fortunes twenty times above 
Her that so wishes  and her humble love 

No better  if you please 

My wish receive 
Which great Love grant  and so I take my leave 

Do all they deny her  An they were sons of mine  Id have them whippd or I would send them to the Turk to make eunuchs of 

Be not afraid that I your hand should take 
Ill never do you wrong for your own sake 
Blessing upon your vows  and in your bed 
Find fairer fortune  if you ever wed 

These boys are boys of ice  theyll none have her  sure  they are bastards to the English  the French neer got em 

You are too young  too happy  and too good 
To make yourself a son out of my blood 

Fair one  I think not so 

Theres one grape yet  I am sure thy father drunk wine  But if thou best not an ass  I am a youth of fourteen  I have known thee already 

I dare not say I take you  but I give 
Me and my service  ever whilst I live 
Into your guiding power  This is the man 

Why then  young Bertram  take her  shes thy wife 

My wife  my liege  I shall beseech your highness 
In such a business give me leave to use 
The help of mine own eyes 

Knowst thou not  Bertram 
What she has done for me 

Yes  my good lord 
But never hope to know why I should marry her 

Thou knowst she has raisd me from my sickly bed 

But follows it  my lord  to bring me down 
Must answer for your raising  I know her well 
She had her breeding at my fathers charge 
A poor physicians daughter my wife  Disdain 
Rather corrupt me ever 

Tis only title thou disdainst in her  the which 
I can build up  Strange is it that our bloods 
Of colour  weight  and heat  pourd all together 
Would quite confound distinction  yet stand off 
In differences so mighty  If she be 
All that is virtuous  save what thou dislikst 
A poor physicians daughter  thou dislikst 
Of virtue for the name  but do not so 
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed 
The place is dignified by the doers deed 
Where great additions swells  and virtue none 
It is a dropsied honour  Good alone 
Is good without a name  vileness is so 
The property by what it is should go 
Not by the title  She is young  wise  fair 
In these to nature shes immediate heir 
And these breed honour  that is honours scorn 
Which challenges itself as honours born 
And is not like the sire  honours thrive 
When rather from our acts we them derive 
Than our foregoers  The mere words a slave 
Deboshd on every tomb  on every grave 
A lying trophy  and as oft is dumb 
Where dust and damnd oblivion is the tomb 
Of honourd bones indeed  What should be said 
If thou canst like this creature as a maid 
I can create the rest  virtue and she 
Is her own dower  honour and wealth from me 

I cannot love her  nor will strive to dot 

Thou wrongst thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose 

That you are well restord  my lord  Im glad 
Let the rest go 

My honours at the stake  which to defeat 
I must produce my power  Here  take her hand 
Proud scornful boy  unworthy this good gift 
That dost in vile misprision shackle up 
My love and her desert  thou canst not dream 
We  poising us in her defective scale 
Shall weigh thee to the beam  that wilt not know 
It is in us to plant thine honour where 
We please to have it grow  Check thy contempt 
Obey our will  which travails in thy good 
Believe not thy disdain  but presently 
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right 
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims 
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever 
Into the staggers and the careless lapse 
Of youth and ignorance  both my revenge and hate 
Loosing upon thee  in the name of justice 
Without all terms of pity  Speak  thine answer 

Pardon  my gracious lord  for I submit 
My fancy to your eyes  When I consider 
What great creation and what dole of honour 
Flies where you bid it  I find that she  which late 
Was in my nobler thoughts most base  is now 
The praised of the king  who  so ennobled 
Is  as twere  born so 

Take her by the hand 
And tell her she is thine  to whom I promise 
A counterpoise  if not to thy estate 
A balance more replete 

I take her hand 

Good fortune and the favour of the king 
Smile upon this contract  whose ceremony 
Shall seem expedient on the nowborn brief 
And be performd tonight  the solemn feast 
Shall more attend upon the coming space 
Expecting absent friends  As thou lovst her 
Thy loves to me religious  else  does err 


Do you hear  monsieur  a word with you 

Your pleasure  sir 

Your lord and master did well to make his recantation 

Recantation  My lord  my master 

Ay  is it not a language I speak 

A most harsh one  and not to be understood without bloody succeeding  My master 

Are you companion to the Count Rousillon 

To any count  to all counts  to what is man 

To what is counts man  counts master is of another style 

You are too old  sir  let it satisfy you  you are too old 

I must tell thee  sirrah  I write man  to which title age cannot bring thee 

What I dare too well do  I dare not do 

I did think thee  for two ordinaries  to be a pretty wise fellow  thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel  it might pass  yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden  I have now found thee  when I lose thee again  I care not  yet art thou good for nothing but taking up  and that thourt scarce worth 

Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee 

Do not plunge thyself too far in anger  lest thou hasten thy trial  which if Lord have mercy on thee for a hen  So  my good window of lattice  fare thee well  thy casement I need not open  for I look through thee  Give me thy hand 

My lord  you give me most egregious indignity 

Ay  with all my heart  and thou art worthy of it 

I have not  my lord  deserved it 

Yes  good faith  every dram of it  and I will not bate thee a scruple 

Well  I shall be wiser 

Een as soon as thou canst  for thou hast to pull at a smack o the contrary  If ever thou best bound in thy scarf and beaten  thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage  I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee  or rather my knowledge  that I may say in the default  he is a man I know 

My lord  you do me most insupportable vexation 

I would it were hellpains for thy sake  and my poor doing eternal  for doing I am past  as I will by thee  in what motion age will give me leave 


Well  thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me  scurvy  old  filthy  scurvy lord  Well  I must be patient  there is no fettering of authority  Ill beat him  by my life  if I can meet him with any convenience  an he were double and double a lord  Ill have no more pity of his age than I would have of Ill beat him  an if I could but meet him again 


Sirrah  your lord and masters married  theres news for you  you have a new mistress 

I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs  he is my good lord  whom I serve above is my master 

Who  God 

Ay  sir 

The devil it is thats thy master  Why dost thou garter up thy arms o this fashion  dost make hose of thy sleeves  do other servants so  Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands  By mine honour  if I were but two hours younger  Id beat thee  methinks thou art a general offence  and every man should beat thee  I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee 

This is hard and undeserved measure  my lord 

Go to  sir  you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate  you are a vagabond and no true traveller  you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the heraldry of your birth and virtue gives you commission  You are not worth another word  else Id call you knave  I leave you 


Good  very good  it is so then  good  very good  Let it be concealed awhile 


Undone  and forfeited to cares for ever 

What is the matter  sweet heart 

Although before the solemn priest I have sworn 
I will not bed her 

What  what  sweet heart 

O my Parolles  they have married me 
Ill to the Tuscan wars  and never bed her 

France is a doghole  and it no more merits 
The tread of a mans foot  To the wars 

Theres letters from my mother  what the import is 
I know not yet 

Ay  that would be known  To the wars  my boy  to the wars 
He wears his honour in a box  unseen 
That hugs his kickywicky here at home 
Spending his manly marrow in her arms 
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet 
Of Marss fiery steed  To other regions 
France is a stable  we that dwell int jades 
Therefore  to the war 

It shall be so  Ill send her to my house 
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her 
And wherefore I am fled  write to the king 
That which I durst not speak  his present gift 
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields 
Where noble fellows strike  War is no strife 
To the dark house and the detested wife 

Will this capriccio hold in thee  art sure 

Go with me to my chamber  and advise me 
Ill send her straight away  tomorrow 
Ill to the wars  she to her single sorrow 

Why  these balls bound  theres noise in it  Tis hard 
A young man married is a man thats marrd 
Therefore away  and leave her bravely  go 
The king has done you wrong  but  hush  tis so 


My mother greets me kindly  is she well 

She is not well  but yet she has her health  shes very merry  but yet she is not well  but thanks be given  shes very well  and wants nothing i the world  but yet she is not well 

If she be very well  what does she ail that shes not very well 

Truly  shes very well indeed  but for two things 

What two things 

One  that shes not in heaven  whither 
God send her quickly  the other  that shes in earth  from whence God send her quickly 


Bless you  my fortunate lady 

I hope  sir  I have your good will to have mine own good fortunes 

You had my prayers to lead them on  and to keep them on  have them still  O  my knave  how does my old lady 

So that you had her wrinkles  and I her money  I would she did as you say 

Why  I say nothing 

Marry  you are the wiser man  for many a mans tongue shakes out his masters undoing  To say nothing  to do nothing  to know nothing  and to have nothing  is to be a great part of your title  which is within a very little of nothing 

Away  thourt a knave 

You should have said  sir  before a knave thourt a knave  that is  before me thourt a knave  this had been truth  sir 

Go to  thou art a witty fool  I have found thee 

Did you find me in yourself  sir  or were you taught to find me  The search  sir  was profitable  and much fool may you find in you  even to the worlds pleasure and the increase of laughter 

A good knave  i faith  and well fed 
Madam  my lord will go away tonight 
A very serious business calls on him 
The great prerogative and rite of love 
Which  as your due  time claims  he does acknowledge 
But puts it off to a compelld restraint 
Whose want  and whose delay  is strewd with sweets 
Which they distil now in the curbed time 
To make the coming hour oerflow with joy 
And pleasure drown the brim 

Whats his will else 

That you will take your instant leave o the king 
And make this haste as your own good proceeding 
Strengthend with what apology you think 
May make it probable need 

What more commands he 

That  having this obtaind  you presently 
Attend his further pleasure 

In everything I wait upon his will 

I shall report it so 

I pray you  Come  sirrah 


But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier 

Yes  my lord  and of very valiant approof 

You have it from his own deliverance 

And by other warranted testimony 

Then my dial goes not true  I took this lark for a bunting 

I do assure you  my lord  he is very great in knowledge  and accordingly valiant 

I have then sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valour  and my state that way is dangerous  since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent  Here he comes  I pray you  make us friends  I will pursue the amity 


These things shall be done  sir 

Pray you  sir  whos his tailor 

Sir 

O  I know him well  Ay  sir  he  sir  is a good workman  a very good tailor 

Is she gone to the king 

She is 

Will she away tonight 

As youll have her 

I have writ my letters  casketed my treasure 
Given orders for our horses  and tonight 
When I should take possession of the bride 
End ere I do begin 

A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner  but one that lies three thirds  and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with  should be once heard and thrice beaten  God save you  captain 

Is there any unkindness between my lord and you  monsieur 

I know not how I have deserved to run into my lords displeasure 

You have made shift to run intot  boots and spurs and all  like him that leaped into the custard  and out of it youll run again  rather than suffer question for your residence 

It may be you have mistaken him  my lord 

And shall do so ever  though I took him at his prayers  Fare you well  my lord  and believe this of me  there can be no kernel in this light nut  the soul of this man is his clothes  Trust him not in matter of heavy consequence  I have kept of them tame  and know their natures  Farewell  monsieur  I have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand  but we must do good against evil 


An idle lord  I swear 

I think not so 

Why  do you not know him 

Yes  I do know him well  and common speech 
Gives him a worthy pass  Here comes my clog 


I have  sir  as I was commanded from you 
Spoke with the king  and have procurd his leave 
For present parting  only  he desires 
Some private speech with you 

I shall obey his will 
You must not marvel  Helen  at my course 
Which holds not colour with the time  nor does 
The ministration and required office 
On my particular  prepard I was not 
For such a business  therefore am I found 
So much unsettled  This drives me to entreat you 
That presently you take your way for home 
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you 
For my respects are better than they seem 
And my appointments have in them a need 
Greater than shows itself at the first view 
To you that know them not  This to my mother 

Twill be two days ere I shall see you  so 
I leave you to your wisdom 

Sir  I can nothing say 
But that I am your most obedient servant 

Come  come  no more of that 

And ever shall 
With true observance seek to eke out that 
Wherein toward me my homely stars have faild 
To equal my great fortune 

Let that go 
My haste is very great  Farewell  hie home 

Pray sir  your pardon 

Well  what would you say 

I am not worthy of the wealth I owe 
Nor dare I say tis mine  and yet it is 
But  like a timorous thief  most fain would steal 
What law does vouch mine own 

What would you have 

Something  and scarce so much  nothing  indeed 
I would not tell you what I would  my lord 
Faith  yes 
Strangers and foes do sunder  and not kiss 

I pray you  stay not  but in haste to horse 

I shall not break your bidding  good my lord 

Farewell 

Go thou toward home  where I will never come 
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum 
Away  and for our flight 

Bravely  coragio 

So that from point to point now have you heard 
The fundamental reasons of this war 
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth 
And more thirsts after 

Holy seems the quarrel 
Upon your Graces part  black and fearful 
On the opposer 

Therefore we marvel much our cousin France 
Would in so just a business shut his bosom 
Against our borrowing prayers 

Good my lord 
The reasons of our state I cannot yield 
But like a common and an outward man 
That the great figure of a council frames 
By selfunable motion  therefore dare not 
Say what I think of it  since I have found 
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail 
As often as I guessd 

Be it his pleasure 

But I am sure the younger of our nature 
That surfeit on their ease  will day by day 
Come here for physic 

Welcome shall they be 
And all the honours that can fly from us 
Shall on them settle  You know your places well 
When better fall  for your avails they fell 
Tomorrow to the field 


It hath happened all as I would have had it  save that he comes not along with her 

By my troth  I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man 

By what observance  I pray you 

Why  he will look upon his boot and sing  mend the ruff and sing  ask questions and sing  pick his teeth and sing  I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song 

Let me see what he writes  and when he means to come 

I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court  Our old ling and our Isbels o the country are nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o the court  the brains of my Cupids knocked out  and I begin to love  as an old man loves money  with no stomach 

What have we here 

Een that you have there 


I have sent you a daughterinlaw  she hath recovered the king  and undone me  I have wedded her  not bedded her  and sworn to make the not eternal  You shall hear I am ran away  know it before the report come  If there be breadth enough in the world  I will hold a long distance  My duty to you 
Your unfortunate son 
This is not well  rash and unbridled boy 
To fly the favours of so good a king 
To pluck his indignation on thy head 
By the misprising of a maid too virtuous 
For the contempt of empire 


O madam  yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady 

What is the matter 

Nay  there is some comfort in the news  some comfort  your son will not be killed so soon as I thought he would 

Why should he be killed 

So say I  madam  if he run away  as I hear he does  the danger is in standing tot  thats the loss of men  though it be the getting of children  Here they come will tell you more  for my part  I only hear your son was run away 

Save you  good madam 

Madam  my lord is gone  for ever gone 

Do not say so 

Think upon patience  Pray you  gentlemen 
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief 
That the first face of neither  on the start 
Can woman me unto t  where is my son  I pray you 

Madam  hes gone to serve the Duke of Florence 
We met him thitherward  for thence we came 
And  after some dispatch in hand at court 
Thither we bend again 

Look on his letter  madam  heres my passport 
When thou canst get the ring upon my finger  which never shall come off  and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to  then call me husband  but in such a then I write a never  
This is a dreadful sentence 

Brought you this letter  gentlemen 

Ay  madam 
And for the contents sake are sorry for our pains 

I prithee  lady  have a better cheer 
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine 
Thou robbst me of a moiety  he was my son 
But I do wash his name out of my blood 
And thou art all my child  Towards Florence is he 

Ay  madam 

And to be a soldier 

Such is his noble purpose  and  believet 
The duke will lay upon him all the honour 
That good convenience claims 

Return you thither 

Ay  madam  with the swiftest wing of speed 

Till I have no wife  I have nothing in France 
Tis bitter 

Find you that there 

Ay  madam 

Tis but the boldness of his hand  haply  which his heart was not consenting to 

Nothing in France until he have no wife 
Theres nothing here that is too good for him 
But only she  and she deserves a lord 
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon 
And call her hourly mistress  Who was with him 

A servant only  and a gentleman 
Which I have some time known 

Parolles  was it not 

Ay  my good lady  he 

A very tainted fellow  and full of wickedness 
My son corrupts a wellderived nature 
With his inducement 

Indeed  good lady 
The fellow has a deal of that too much 
Which holds him much to have 

Yare welcome  gentlemen 
I will entreat you  when you see my son 
To tell him that his sword can never win 
The honour that he loses  more Ill entreat you 
Written to bear along 

We serve you  madam 
In that and all your worthiest affairs 

Not so  but as we change our courtesies 
Will you draw near 


Till I have no wife  I have nothing in France  
Nothing in France until he has no wife 
Thou shalt have none  Rousillon  none in France 
Then hast thou all again  Poor lord  ist I 
That chase thee from thy country  and expose 
Those tender limbs of thine to the event 
Of the nonsparing war  and is it I 
That drive thee from the sportive court  where thou 
Wast shot at with fair eyes  to be the mark 
Of smoky muskets  O you leaden messengers 
That ride upon the violent speed of fire 
Fly with false aim  move the stillpiecing air 
That sings with piercing  do not touch my lord 
Whoever shoots at him  I set him there 
Whoever charges on his forward breast 
I am the caitiff that do hold him tot 
And  though I kill him not  I am the cause 
His death was so effected  better twere 
I met the ravin lion when he roard 
With sharp constraint of hunger  better twere 
That all the miseries which nature owes 
Were mine at once  No  come thou home  Rousillon 
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar 
As oft it loses all  I will be gone 
My being here it is that holds thee hence 
Shall I stay here to dot  no  no  although 
The air of paradise did fan the house 
And angels officd all  I will be gone 
That pitiful rumour may report my flight 
To consolate thine ear  Come  night  end  day 
For with the dark  poor thief  Ill steal away 


The general of our horse thou art  and we 
Great in our hope  lay our best love and credence 
Upon thy promising fortune 

Sir  it is 
A charge too heavy for my strength  but yet 
Well strive to bear it for your worthy sake 
To the extreme edge of hazard 

Then go thou forth 
And fortune play upon thy prosprous helm 
As thy auspicious mistress 

This very day 
Great Mars  I put myself into thy file 
Make me but like my thoughts  and I shall prove 
A lover of thy drum  hater of love 


Alas  and would you take the letter of her 
Might you not know she would do as she has done 
By sending me a letter  Read it again 

I am Saint Jaques pilgrim  thither gone 

Ambitious love hath so in me offended 
That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon 
With sainted vow my faults to have amended 
Write  write  that from the bloody course of war 
My dearest master  your dear son  may hie 
Bless him at home in peace  whilst I from far 
His name with zealous fervour sanctify 
His taken labours bid him me forgive 
I  his despiteful Juno  sent him forth 
From courtly friends  with camping foes to live 
Where death and danger dog the heels of worth 
He is too good and fair for Death and me 
Whom I myself embrace  to set him free 


Ah  what sharp stings are in her mildest words 
Rinaldo  you did never lack advice so much 
As letting her pass so  had I spoke with her 
I could have well diverted her intents 
Which thus she hath prevented 

Pardon me  madam 
If I had given you this at overnight 
She might have been oertaen  and yet she writes 
Pursuit would be but vain 

What angel shall 
Bless this unworthy husband  he cannot thrive 
Unless her prayers  whom heaven delights to hear 
And loves to grant  reprieve him from the wrath 
Of greatest justice  Write  write  Rinaldo 
To this unworthy husband of his wife 
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth 
That he does weigh too light  my greatest grief 
Though little he do feel it  set down sharply 
Dispatch the most convenient messenger 
When haply he shall hear that she is gone 
He will return  and hope I may that she 
Hearing so much  will speed her foot again 
Led hither by pure love  Which of them both 
Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense 
To make distinction  Provide this messenger 
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak 
Grief would have tears  and sorrow bids me speak 


Nay  come  for if they do approach the city we shall lose all the sight 

They say the French Count has done most honourable service 

It is reported that he has taken their greatest commander  and that with his own hand he slew the dukes brother  We have lost our labour  they are gone a contrary way  hark  you may know by their trumpets 

Come  lets return again  and suffice ourselves with the report of it  Well  Diana  take heed of this French earl  the honour of a maid is her name  and no legacy is so rich as honesty 

I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion 

I know that knave  hang him  one Parolles  a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl  Beware of them  Diana  their promises  enticements  oaths  tokens  and all these engines of lust  are not the things they go under  many a maid hath been seduced by them  and the misery is  example  that so terrible shows in the wrack of maidenhood  cannot for all that dissuade succession  but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them  I hope I need not to advise you further  but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are  though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost 

You shall not need to fear me 

I hope so  Look  here comes a pilgrim 
I know she will lie at my house  thither they send one another  Ill question her 

God save you  pilgrim  whither are you bound 

To Saint Jaques le Grand 
Where do the palmers lodge  I do beseech you 

At the Saint Francis  here beside the port 

Is this the way 

Ay  marry  ist  Hark you 

They come this way  If you will tarry  holy pilgrim 
But till the troops come by 
I will conduct you where you shall be lodgd 
The rather  for I think I know your hostess 
As ample as myself 

Is it yourself 

If you shall please so  pilgrim 

I thank you  and will stay upon your leisure 

You came  I think  from France 

I did so 

Here you shall see a countryman of yours 
That has done worthy service 

His name  I pray you 

The Count Rousillon  know you such a one 

But by the ear  that hears most nobly of him 
His face I know not 

Whatsoeer he is 
Hes bravely taken here  He stole from France 
As tis reported  for the king had married him 
Against his liking  Think you it is so 

Ay  surely  mere the truth  I know his lady 

There is a gentleman that serves the count 
Reports but coarsely of her 

Whats his name 

Monsieur Parolles 

O  I believe with him 
In argument of praise  or to the worth 
Of the great count himself  she is too mean 
To have her name repeated  all her deserving 
Is a reserved honesty  and that 
I have not heard examind 

Alas  poor lady 
Tis a hard bondage to become the wife 
Of a detesting lord 

Ay  right  good creature  wheresoeer she is 
Her heart weighs sadly  This young maid might do her 
A shrewd turn if she pleasd 

How do you mean 
May be the amorous count solicits her 
In the unlawful purpose 

He does  indeed 
And brokes with all that can in such a suit 
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid 
But she is armd for him and keeps her guard 
In honestest defence 

The gods forbid else 


So  now they come 
That is Antonio  the dukes eldest son 
That  Escalus 

Which is the Frenchman 

He 
That with the plume  tis a most gallant fellow 
I would he lovd his wife  If he were honester 
He were much goodlier  ist not a handsome gentleman 

I like him well 

Tis pity he is not honest  Yonds that same knave 
That leads him to these places  were I his lady 
I would poison that vile rascal 

Which is he 

That jackanapes with scarfs  Why is he melancholy 

Perchance hes hurt i the battle 

Lose our drum  well 

Hes shrewdly vexed at something 
Look  he has spied us 

Marry  hang you 

And your courtesy  for a ringcarrier 


The troop is past  Come  pilgrim  I will bring you 
Where you shall host  of enjoind penitents 
Theres four or five  to great Saint Jaques bound 
Already at my house 

I humbly thank you 
Please it this matron and this gentle maid 
To eat with us tonight  the charge and thanking 
Shall be for me  and  to requite you further 
I will bestow some precepts of this virgin 
Worthy the note 

Well take your offer kindly 


Nay  good my lord  put him tot  let him have his way 

If your lordship find him not a hilding  hold me no more in your respect 

On my life  my lord  a bubble 

Do you think I am so far deceived in him 

Believe it  my lord  in mine own direct knowledge  without any malice  but to speak of him as my kinsman  hes a most notable coward  an infinite and endless liar  an hourly promisebreaker  the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordships entertainment 

It were fit you knew him  lest  reposing too far in his virtue  which he hath not  he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you 

I would I knew in what particular action to try him 

None better than to let him fetch off his drum  which you hear him so confidently undertake to do 

I  with a troop of Florentines  will suddenly surprise him  such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy  We will bind and hood wink him so  that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries  when we bring him to our own tents  Be but your lordship present at his examination  if he do not  for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear  offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you  and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath  never trust my judgment in anything 

O  for the love of laughter  let him fetch his drum  he says he has a stratagem fort  When your lordship sees the bottom of his success int  and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted  if you give him not John Drums entertainment  your inclining cannot be removed  Here he comes 

O  for the love of laughter  hinder not the honour of his design  let him fetch off his drum in any hand 


How now  monsieur  this drum sticks sorely in your disposition 

A pox ont  let it go  tis but a drum 

But a drum  Ist but a drum  A drum so lost  There was excellent command  to charge in with our horse upon our own wings  and to rend our own soldiers 

That was not to be blamed in the command of the service  it was a disaster of war that C sar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to command 

Well  we cannot greatly condemn our success  some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum  but it is not to be recovered 

It might have been recovered 

It might  but it is not now 

It is to be recovered  But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer  I would have that drum or another  or hic jacet 

Why  if you have a stomach tot  monsieur  if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into its native quarter  be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on  I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit  if you speed well in it  the duke shall both speak of it  and extend to you what further becomes his greatness  even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness 

By the hand of a soldier  I will undertake it 

But you must not now slumber in it 

Ill about it this evening  and I will presently pen down my dilemmas  encourage myself in my certainty  put myself into my mortal preparation  and by midnight look to hear further from me 

May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it 

I know not what the success will be  my lord  but the attempt I vow 

I know thourt valiant  and  to the possibility of thy soldiership  will subscribe for thee  Farewell 

I love not many words 


No more than a fish loves water  Is not this a strange fellow  my lord  that so confidently seems to undertake this business  which he knows is not to be done  damns himself to do  and dares better be damned than to dot 

You do not know him  my lord  as we do  certain it is  that he will steal himself into a mans favour  and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries  but when you find him out you have him ever after 

Why  do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto 

None in the world  but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies  But we have almost embossed him  you shall see his fall tonight  for  indeed  he is not for your lordships respect 

Well make you some sport with the fox ere we case him  He was first smoked by the old Lord Lafeu  when his disguise and he is parted  tell me what a sprat you shall find him  which you shall see this very night 

I must go look my twigs  he shall be caught 

Your brother he shall go along with me 

Ast please your lordship  Ill leave you 


Now will I lead you to the house  and show you 
The lass I spoke of 

But you say shes honest 

Thats all the fault  I spoke with her but once 
And found her wondrous cold  but I sent to her 
By this same coxcomb that we have i the wind 
Tokens and letters which she did resend 
And this is all I have done  Shes a fair creature 
Will you go see her 

With all my heart  my lord 


If you misdoubt me that I am not she 
I know not how I shall assure you further 
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon 

Though my estate be falln  I was well born 
Nothing acquainted with these businesses 
And would not put my reputation now 
In any staining act 

Nor would I wish you 
First  give me trust  the county is my husband 
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken 
Is so from word to word  and then you cannot 
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow 
Err in bestowing it 

I should believe you 
For you have showd me that which well approves 
Youre great in fortune 

Take this purse of gold 
And let me buy your friendly help thus far 
Which I will overpay and pay again 
When I have found it  The county woos your daughter 
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty 
Resolvd to carry her  let her in fine consent 
As well direct her how tis best to bear it 
Now  his important blood will nought deny 
That shell demand  a ring the county wears 
That down ward hath succeeded in his house 
From son to son  some four or five descents 
Since the first father wore it  this ring he holds 
In most rich choice  yet  in his idle fire 
To buy his will  it would not seem too dear 
Howeer repented after 

Now I see 
The bottom of your purpose 

You see it lawful then  It is no more 
But that your daughter  ere she seems as won 
Desires this ring  appoints him an encounter 
In fine  delivers me to fill the time 
Herself most chastely absent  After this 
To marry her  Ill add three thousand crowns 
To what is past already 

I have yielded 
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever 
That time and place with this deceit so lawful 
May prove coherent  Every night he comes 
With musics of all sorts and songs composd 
To her unworthiness  it nothing steads us 
To chide him from our eaves  for he persists 
As if his life lay ont 

Why then tonight 
Let us assay our plot  which  if it speed 
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed 
And lawful meaning in a lawful act 
Where both not sin  and yet a sinful fact 
But lets about it 

He can come no other way but by this hedgecorner  When you sally upon him  speak what terrible language you will  though you understand it not yourselves  no matter  for we must not seem to understand him  unless some one among us  whom we must produce for an interpreter 

Good captain  let me be the interpreter 

Art not acquainted with him  knows he not thy voice 

No  sir  I warrant you 

But what linseywoolsey hast thou to speak to us again 

Even such as you speak to me 

He must think us some band of strangers i the adversarys entertainment  Now  he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages  therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy  not to know what we speak one to another  so we seem to know  is to know straight our purpose  choughs language  gabble enough  and good enough  As for you  interpreter  you must seem very politic  But couch  ho  here he comes  to beguile two hours in a sleep  and then to return and swear the lies he forges 


Ten oclock  within these three hours twill be time enough to go home  What shall I say I have done  It must be a very plausive invention that carries it  They begin to smoke me  and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door  I find my tongue is too foolhardy  but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it and of his creatures  not daring the reports of my tongue 

This is the first truth that eer thine own tongue was guilty of 

What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum  being not ignorant of the impossibility  and knowing I had no such purpose  I must give myself some hurts and say I got them in exploit  Yet slight ones will not carry it  they will say  Came you off with so little  and great ones I dare not give  Wherefore  whats the instance  Tongue  I must put you into a butterwomans mouth  and buy myself another of Bajazets mute  if you prattle me into these perils 

Is it possible he should know what he is  and be that he is 

I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn or the breaking of my Spanish sword 

We cannot afford you so 

Or the baring of my beard  and to say it was in stratagem 

Twould not do 

Or to drown my clothes  and say I was stripped 

Hardly serve 

Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel 

How deep 

Thirty fathom 

Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed 

I would I had any drum of the enemys 
I would swear I recovered it 

Thou shalt hear one anon 

A drum now of the enemys

And I shall lose my life for want of language

The general is content to spare thee yet 
And  hoodwinkd as thou art  will lead thee on 
To gather from thee  haply thou mayst inform 
Something to save thy life 

O  let me live 
And all the secrets of our camp Ill show 
Their force  their purposes  nay  Ill speak that 
Which you will wonder at 

But wilt thou faithfully 

If I do not  damn me 

Acordo linta

Go  tell the Count Rousillon  and my brother 
We have caught the woodcock  and will keep him muffled 
Till we do hear from them 

Captain  I will 

A will betray us all unto ourselves 
Inform on that 

So I will  sir 

Till then  Ill keep him dark and safely lockd 


They told me that your name was Fontibell 

No  my good lord  Diana 

Titled goddess 
And worth it  with addition  But  fair soul 
In your fine frame hath love no quality 
If the quick fire of youth light not your mind 
You are no maiden  but a monument 
When you are dead  you should be such a one 
As you are now  for you are cold and stern 
And now you should be as your mother was 
When your sweet self was got 

She then was honest 

So should you be 

No 
My mother did but duty  such  my lord 
As you owe to your wife 

No more o that 
I prithee do not strive against my vows 
I was compelld to her  but I love thee 
By loves own sweet constraint  and will for ever 
Do thee all rights of service 

Ay  so you serve us 
Till we serve you  but when you have our roses 
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves 
And mock us with our bareness 

How have I sworn 

Tis not the many oaths that make the truth 
But the plain single vow that is vowd true 
What is not holy  that we swear not by 
But take the Highest to witness  then  pray you  tell me 
If I should swear by Gods great attributes 
I lovd you dearly  would you believe my oaths 
When I did love you ill  this has no holding 
To swear by him whom I protest to love 
That I will work against him  therefore your oaths 
Are words and poor conditions  but unseald 
At least in my opinion 

Change it  change it 
Be not so holycruel  love is holy 
And my integrity neer knew the crafts 
That you do charge men with  Stand no more off 
But give thyself unto my sick desires 
Who then recover  say thou art mine  and ever 
My love as it begins shall so persever 

I see that men make ropes in such a scarr 
That well forsake ourselves  Give me that ring 

Ill lend it thee  my dear  but have no power 
To give it from me 

Will you not  my lord 

It is an honour longing to our house 
Bequeathed down from many ancestors 
Which were the greatest obloquy i the world 
In me to lose 

Mine honours such a ring 
My chastitys the jewel of our house 
Bequeathed down from many ancestors 
Which were the greatest obloquy i the world 
In me to lose  Thus your own proper wisdom 
Brings in the champion honour on my part 
Against your vain assault 

Here  take my ring 
My house  mine honour  yea  my life  be thine 
And Ill be bid by thee 

When midnight comes  knock at my chamberwindow 
Ill order take my mother shall not hear 
Now will I charge you in the band of truth 
When you have conquerd my yet maiden bed 
Remain there but an hour  nor speak to me 
My reasons are most strong  and you shall know them 
When back again this ring shall be deliverd 
And on your finger in the night Ill put 
Another ring  that what in time proceeds 
May token to the future our past deeds 
Adieu  till then  then  fail not  You have won 
A wife of me  though there my hope be done 

A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee 


For which live long to thank both heaven and me 
You may so in the end 
My mother told me just how he would woo 
As if she sat in s heart  she says all men 
Have the like oaths  he had sworn to marry me 
When his wifes dead  therefore Ill lie with him 
When I am buried  Since Frenchmen are so braid 
Marry that will  I live and die a maid 
Only in this disguise I thinkt no sin 
To cozen him that would unjustly win 


You have not given him his mothers letter 

I have delivered it an hour since  there is something int that stings his nature  for on the reading it he changed almost into another man 

He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady 

Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king  who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him  I will tell you a thing  but you shall let it dwell darkly with you 

When you have spoken it  tis dead  and I am the grave of it 

He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence  of a most chaste renown  and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour  he hath given her his monumental ring  and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition 

Now  God delay our rebellion  as we are ourselves  what things are we 

Merely our own traitors  and as in the common course of all treasons  we still see them reveal themselves  till they attain to their abhorred ends  so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility  in his proper stream oerflows himself 

Is it not most damnable in us  to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents  We shall not then have his company tonight 

Not till after midnight  for he is dieted to his hour 

That approaches apace  I would gladly have him see his company anatomized  that he might take a measure of his own judgments  wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit 

We will not meddle with him till he come  for his presence must be the whip of the other 

In the meantime what near you of these wars 

I hear there is an overture of peace 

Nay  I assure you  a peace concluded 

What will Count Rousillon do then  will he travel higher  or return again into France 

I perceive by this demand  you are not altogether of his council 

Let it be forbid  sir  so should I be a great deal of his act 

Sir  his wife some two months since fled from his house  her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand  which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished  and  there residing  the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief  in fine  made a groan of her last breath  and now she sings in heaven 

How is this justified 

The stronger part of it by her own letters  which make her story true  even to the point of her death  her death itself  which could not be her office to say is come  was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place 

Hath the count all this intelligence 

Ay  and the particular confirmations  point from point  to the full arming of the verity 

I am heartily sorry that hell be glad of this 

How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses 

And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears  The great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample 

The web of our life is of a mingled yarn  good and ill together  our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not  and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues 

How now  wheres your master 

He met the duke in the street  sir  of whom he hath taken a solemn leave  his lordship will next morning for France  The duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king 

They shall be no more than needful there  if they were more than they can commend 

They cannot be too sweet for the kings tartness  Heres his lordship now 

How now  my lord  ist not after midnight 

I have tonight dispatched sixteen businesses  a months length apiece  by an abstract of success  I have conged with the duke  done my adieu with his nearest  buried a wife  mourned for her  writ to my lady mother I am returning  entertained my convoy  and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs  the last was the greatest  but that I have not ended yet 

If the business be of any difficulty  and this morning your departure hence  it requires haste of your lordship 

I mean  the business is not ended  as fearing to hear of it hereafter  But shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier  Come  bring forth this counterfeit model  he has deceived me  like a doublemeaning prophesier 

Bring him forth 

Has sat i the stocks all night  poor gallant knave 

No matter  his heels have deserved it  in usurping his spurs so long  How does he carry himself 

I have told your lordship already  the stocks carry him  But to answer you as you would be understood  he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk  he hath confessed himself to Morgan whom he supposes to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i the stocks  and what think you he hath confessed 

Nothing of me  has a 

His confession is taken  and it shall be read to his face  if your lordship be int  as I believe you are  you must have the patience to hear it 


A plague upon him  muffled  he can say nothing of me  hush  hush 

Hoodman comes  Porto tartarossa 

He calls for the tortures  what will you say without em 

I will confess what I know without constraint  if ye pinch me like a pasty  I can say no more 

Bosko chimurcho 

Boblibindo chicurmurco 

You are a merciful general  Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note 

And truly  as I hope to live 

First  demand of him how many horse the duke is strong  What say you to that 

Five or six thousand  but very weak and unserviceable  the troops are all scattered  and the commanders very poor rogues  upon my reputation and credit  and as I hope to live 

Shall I set down your answer so 

Do  Ill take the sacrament ont  how and which way you will 

Alls one to him  What a pastsaving slave is this 

You are deceived  my lord  this is Monsieur Parolles  the gallant militarist that was his own phrase that had the whole theorick of war in the knot of his scarf  and the practice in the chape of his dagger 

I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean  nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly 

Well  thats set down 

Five or six thousand horse  I said I will say true or thereabouts  set down  for Ill speak truth 

Hes very near the truth in this 

But I con him no thanks fort  in the nature he delivers it 

Poor rogues  I pray you  say 

Well  thats set down 

I humbly thank you  sir  A truths a truth  the rogues are marvellous poor 

Demand of him  of what strength they are afoot  What say you to that 

By my troth  sir  if I were to live this present hour  I will tell true  Let me see  Spurio  a hundred and fifty  Sebastian  so many  Corambus  so many  Jaques  so many  Guiltian  Cosmo  Lodowick  and Gratii  two hundred fifty each  mine own company  Chitopher  Vaumond  Bentii  two hundred fifty each  so that the musterfile  rotten and sound  upon my life  amounts not to fifteen thousand poll  half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks  lest they shake themselves to pieces 

What shall be done to him 

Nothing  but let him have thanks  Demand of him my condition  and what credit I have with the duke 

Well  thats set down  You shall demand of him  whether one Captain Dumain be i the camp  a Frenchman  what his reputation is with the duke  what his valour  honesty  and expertness in wars  or whether he thinks it were not possible  with wellweighing sums of gold  to corrupt him to a revolt  What say you to this  what do you know of it 

I beseech you  let me answer to the particular of the intergatories  demand them singly 

Do you know this Captain Dumain 

I know him  a was a botchers prentice in Paris  from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieves fool with child  a dumb innocent  that could not say him nay 


Nay  by your leave  hold your hands  though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls 

Well  is this captain in the Duke of Florences camp 

Upon my knowledge he is  and lousy 

Nay  look not so upon me  we shall hear of your lordship anon 

What is his reputation with the duke 

The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine  and writ to me this other day to turn him out o the band  I think I have his letter in my pocket 

Marry  well search 

In good sadness  I do not know  either it is there  or it is upon a file with the dukes other letters in my tent 

Here tis  heres a paper  shall I read it to you 

I do not know if it be it or no 

Our interpreter does it well 

Excellently 

Dian  the counts a fool  and full of gold 

That is not the dukes letter  sir  that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence  one Diana  to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon  a foolish idle boy  but for all that very ruttish  I pray you  sir  put it up again 

Nay  Ill read it first  by your favour 

My meaning int  I protest  was very honest in the behalf of the maid  for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy  who is a whale to virginity  and devours up all the fry it finds 

Damnable bothsides rogue 

When he swears oaths  bid him drop gold  and take it 
After he scores  he never pays the score 
Half won is match well made  match  and well make it 
He neer pays afterdebts  take it before 
And say a soldier  Dian  told thee this 
Men are to mell with  boys are not to kiss 
For count of this  the counts a fool  I know it 
Who pays before  but not when he does owe it 

Thine  as he vowd to thee in thine ear 

He shall be whipped through the army with this rime ins forehead 

This is your devoted friend  sir  the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier 

I could endure anything before but a cat  and now hes a cat to me 

I perceive  sir  by our generals looks  we shall be fain to hang you 

My life  sir  in any case  not that I am afraid to die  but that  my offences being many  I would repent out the remainder of nature  Let me live  sir  in a dungeon  i the stocks  or anywhere  so I may live 

Well see what may be done  so you confess freely  therefore  once more to this Captain Dumain  You have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour  what is his honesty 

He will steal  sir  an egg out of a cloister  for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus  he professes not keeping of oaths  in breaking em he is stronger than Hercules  he will lie  sir  with such volubility  that you would think truth were a fool  drunkenness is his best virtue  for he will be swinedrunk  and in his sleep he does little harm  save to his bedclothes about him  but they know his conditions  and lay him in straw  I have but little more to say  sir  of his honesty  he has everything that an honest man should not have  what an honest man should have  he has nothing 

I begin to love him for this 

For this description of thine honesty  A pox upon him for me  he is more and more a cat 

What say you to his expertness in war 

Faith  sir  he has led the drum before the English tragedians to belie him I will not and more of his soldiership I know not  except  in that country  he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mileend  to instruct for the doubling of files  I would do the man what honour I can  but of this I am not certain 

He hath outvillained villany so far  that the rarity redeems him 

A pox on him  hes a cat still 

His qualities being at this poor price  I need not ask you  if gold will corrupt him to revolt 

Sir  for a cardecu he will sell the feesimple of his salvation  the inheritance of it  and cut the entail from all remainders  and a perpetual succession for it perpetually 

Whats his brother  the other Captain Dumain 

Why does he ask him or me 

Whats he 

Een a crow o the same nest  not altogether so great as the first in goodness  but greater a great deal in evil  He excels his brother for a coward  yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is  In a retreat he outruns any lackey  marry  in coming on he has the cramp 

If your life be saved  will you undertake to betray the Florentine 

Ay  and the captain of his horse  Count Rousillon 

Ill whisper with the general  and know his pleasure 

Ill no more drumming  a plague of all drums  Only to seem to deserve well  and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count  have I run into this danger  Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken 

There is no remedy  sir  but you must die  The general says  you  that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army  and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held  can serve the world for no honest use  therefore you must die  Come  headsman  off with his head 

O Lord  sir  let me live  or let me see my death 

That shall you  and take your leave of all your friends 

So  look about you  know you any here 

Good morrow  noble captain 

God bless you  Captain Parolles 

God save you  noble captain 

Captain  what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu  I am for France 

Good captain  will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon  an I were not a very coward Id compel it of you  but fare you well 


You are undone  captain  all but your scarf  that has a knot ont yet 

Who cannot be crushed with a plot 

If you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame  you might begin an impudent nation  Fare ye well  sir  I am for France too  we shall speak of you there 


Yet am I thankful  if my heart were great 
Twould burst at this  Captain Ill be no more 
But I will eat and drink  and sleep as soft 
As captain shall  simply the thing I am 
Shall make me live  Who knows himself a braggart 
Let him fear this  for it will come to pass 
That every braggart shall be found an ass 
Rust  sword  cool  blushes  and Parolles  live 
Safest in shame  being foold  by foolery thrive 
Theres place and means for every man alive 
Ill after them 


That you may well perceive I have not wrongd you 
One of the greatest in the Christian world 
Shall be my surety  fore whose throne tis needful 
Ere I can perfect mine intents  to kneel 
Time was I did him a desired office 
Dear almost as his life  which gratitude 
Through flinty Tartars bosom would peep forth 
And answer  thanks  I duly am informd 
His Grace is at Marseilles  to which place 
We have convenient convoy  You must know 
I am supposed dead  the army breaking 
My husband hies him home  where  heaven aiding 
And by the leave of my good lord the king 
Well be before our welcome 

Gentle madam 
You never had a servant to whose trust 
Your business was more welcome 

Nor you  mistress 
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour 
To recompense your love  Doubt not but heaven 
Hath brought me up to be your daughters dower 
As it hath fated her to be my motive 
And helper to a husband  But  O strange men 
That can such sweet use make of what they hate 
When saucy trusting of the cozend thoughts 
Defiles the pitchy night  so lust doth play 
With what it loathes for that which is away 
But more of this hereafter  You  Diana 
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer 
Something in my behalf 

Let death and honesty 
Go with your impositions  I am yours 
Upon your will to suffer 

Yet  I pray you 
But with the word the time will bring on summer 
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns 
And be as sweet as sharp  We must away 
Our waggon is prepard  and time revives us 
Alls well that ends well  still the fines the crown 
Whateer the course  the end is the renown 


No  no  no  your son was misled with a snipttaffeta fellow there  whose villanous saffron would have made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in his colour  your daughterinlaw had been alive at this hour  and your son here at home  more advanced by the king than by that redtailed humblebee I speak of 

I would I had not known him  it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating  If she had partaken of my flesh  and cost me the dearest groans of a mother  I could not have owed her a more rooted love 

Twas a good lady  twas a good lady  we may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb 

Indeed  sir  she was the sweetmarjoram of the salad  or  rather the herb of grace 

They are not saladherbs  you knave  they are noseherbs 

I am no great Nebuchadnezzar  sir  I have not much skill in grass 

Whether dost thou profess thyself  a knave  or a fool 

A fool  sir  at a womans service  and a knave at a mans 

Your distinction 

I would cozen the man of his wife  and do his service 

So you were a knave at his service  indeed 

And I would give his wife my bauble  sir  to do her service 

I will subscribe for thee  thou art both knave and fool 

At your service 

No  no  no 

Why  sir  if I cannot serve you  I can serve as great a prince as you are 

Whos that  a Frenchman 

Faith  sir  a has an English name  but his phisnomy is more hotter in France than there 

What prince is that 

The black prince  sir  alias  the prince of darkness  alias  the devil 

Hold thee  theres my purse  I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of  serve him still 

I am a woodland fellow  sir  that always loved a great fire  and the master I speak of  ever keeps a good fire  But  sure  he is the prince of the world  let his nobility remain ins court  I am for the house with the narrow gate  which I take to be too little for pomp to enter  some that humble themselves may  but the many will be too chill and tender  and theyll be for the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire 

Go thy ways  I begin to be aweary of thee  and I tell thee so before  because I would not fall out with thee  Go thy ways  let my horses be well looked to  without any tricks 

If I put any tricks upon em  sir  they shall be jades tricks  which are their own right by the law of nature 


A shrewd knave and an unhappy 

So he is  My lord thats gone made himself much sport out of him  by his authority he remains here  which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness  and  indeed  he has no pace  but runs where he will 

I like him well  tis not amiss  And I was about to tell you  since I heard of the good ladys death  and that my lord your son was upon his return home  I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter  which  in the minority of them both  his majesty  out of a selfgracious remembrance  did first propose  His highness hath promised me to do it  and to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son  there is no fitter matter  How does your ladyship like it 

With very much content  my lord  and I wish it happily effected 

His highness comes post from Marseilles  of as able body as when he numbered thirty  he will be here tomorrow  or I am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom failed 

It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die  I have letters that my son will be here tonight  I shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together 

Madam  I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted 

You need but plead your honourable privilege 

Lady  of that I have made a bold charter  but I thank my God it holds yet 


O madam  yonders my lord your son with a patch of velvet ons face  whether there be a scar under it or no  the velvet knows  but tis a goodly patch of velvet  His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half  but his right cheek is worn bare 

A scar nobly got  or a noble scar  is a good livery of honour  so belike is that 

But it is your carbonadoed face 

Let us go see your son  I pray you  I long to talk with the young noble soldier 

Faith  theres a dozen of em  with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers  which bow the head and nod at every man 

But this exceeding posting  day and night 
Must wear your spirits low  we cannot help it 
But since you have made the days and nights as one 
To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs 
Be bold you do so grow in my requital 
As nothing can unroot you  In happy time 


This man may help me to his majestys ear 

If he would spend his power  God save you  sir 

And you 

Sir  I have seen you in the court of France 

I have been sometimes there 

I do presume  sir  that you are not fallen 
From the report that goes upon your goodness 
And therefore  goaded with most sharp occasions 
Which lay nice manners by  I put you to 
The use of your own virtues  for the which 
I shall continue thankful 

Whats your will 

That it will please you 
To give this poor petition to the king 
And aid me with that store of power you have 
To come into his presence 

The kings not here 

Not here  sir 

Not  indeed 
He hence removd last night  and with more haste 
Than is his use 

Lord  how we lose our pains 

Alls well that ends well yet 
Though time seems so adverse and means unfit 
I do beseech you  whither is he gone 

Marry  as I take it  to Rousillon 
Whither I am going 

I do beseech you  sir 
Since you are like to see the king before me 
Commend the paper to his gracious hand 
Which I presume shall render you no blame 
But rather make you thank your pains for it 
I will come after you with what good speed 
Our means will make us means 

This Ill do for you 

And you shall find yourself to be well thankd 
Whateer falls more  We must to horse again 
Go  go  provide 


Good Monsieur Lavache  give my Lord Lafeu this letter  I have ere now  sir  been better known to you  when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes  but I am now  sir  muddied in Fortunes mood  and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure 

Truly  Fortunes displeasure is but sluttish if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of  I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortunes buttering  Prithee  allow the wind 

Nay  you need not to stop your nose  sir  I spake but by a metaphor 

Indeed  sir  if your metaphor stink  I will stop my nose  or against any mans metaphor  Prithee  get thee further 

Pray you  sir  deliver me this paper 

Foh  prithee  stand away  a paper from Fortunes closestool to give to a nobleman  Look  here he comes himself 


Here is a purr of Fortunes  sir  or of Fortunes cat but not a muskcat that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure  and  as he says  is muddied withal  Pray you  sir  use the carp as you may  for he looks like a poor  decayed  ingenious  foolish  rascally knave  I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort  and leave him to your lordship 

My lord  I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratched 

And what would you have me to do  tis too late to pare her nails now  Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune that she should scratch you  who of herself is a good lady  and would not have knaves thrive long under her  Theres a cardecu for you  Let the justices make you and Fortune friends  I am for other business 

I beseech your honour to hear me one single word 

You beg a single penny more  come  you shall hat  save your word 

My name  my good lord  is Parolles 

You beg more than one word then  Cox my passion  give me your hand  How does your drum 

O  my good lord  you were the first that found me 

Was I  in sooth  and I was the first that lost thee 

It lies in you  my lord  to bring me in some grace  for you did bring me out 

Out upon thee  knave  dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil  one brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out 

The kings coming  I know by his trumpets  Sirrah  inquire further after me  I had talk of you last night  though you are a fool and a knave  you shall eat  go to  follow 

I praise God for you 


We lost a jewel of her  and our esteem 
Was made much poorer by it  but your son 
As mad in folly  lackd the sense to know 
Her estimation home 

Tis past  my liege 
And I beseech your majesty to make it 
Natural rebellion  done i the blaze of youth 
When oil and fire  too strong for reasons force 
Oerbears it and burns on 

My honourd lady 
I have forgiven and forgotten all 
Though my revenges were high bent upon him 
And watchd the time to shoot 

This I must say 
But first I beg my pardon the young lord 
Did to his majesty  his mother  and his lady 
Offence of mighty note  but to himself 
The greatest wrong of all  he lost a wife 
Whose beauty did astonish the survey 
Of richest eyes  whose words all ears took captive 
Whose dear perfection hearts that scornd to serve 
Humbly calld mistress 

Praising what is lost 
Makes the remembrance dear  Well  call him hither 
We are reconcild  and the first view shall kill 
All repetition  Let him not ask our pardon 
The nature of his great offence is dead 
And deeper than oblivion we do bury 
The incensing relics of it  let him approach 
A stranger  no offender  and inform him 
So tis our will he should 

I shall  my liege 


What says he to your daughter  have you spoke 

All that he is hath reference to your highness 

Then shall we have a match  I have letters sent me 
That set him high in fame 


He looks well ont 

I am not a day of season 
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail 
In me at once  but to the brightest beams 
Distracted clouds give way  so stand thou forth 
The time is fair again 

My highrepented blames 
Dear sovereign  pardon to me 

All is whole 
Not one word more of the consumed time 
Lets take the instant by the forward top 
For we are old  and on our quickst decrees 
The inaudible and noiseless foot of time 
Steals ere we can effect them  You remember 
The daughter of this lord 

Admiringly  my liege 
At first I stuck my choice upon her  ere my heart 
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue 
Where the impression of mine eye infixing 
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me 
Which warpd the line of every other favour 
Scornd a fair colour  or expressd it stolen 
Extended or contracted all proportions 
To a most hideous object  thence it came 
That she  whom all men praisd  and whom myself 
Since I have lost  have lovd  was in mine eye 
The dust that did offend it 

Well excusd 
That thou didst love her  strikes some scores away 
From the great compt  But love that comes too late 
Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried 
To the great sender turns a sour offence 
Crying  Thats good thats gone  Our rasher faults 
Make trivial price of serious things we have 
Not knowing them until we know their grave 
Oft our displeasures  to ourselves unjust 
Destroy our friends and after weep their dust 
Our own love waking cries to see whats done 
While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon 
Be this sweet Helens knell  and now forget her 
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin 
The main consents are had  and here well stay 
To see our widowers second marriageday 

Which better than the first  O dear heaven  bless 
Or  ere they meet  in me  O nature  cesse 

Come on  my son  in whom my houses name 
Must be digested  give a favour from you 
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter 
That she may quickly come 

And every hair thats ont  Helen  thats dead 
Was a sweet creature  such a ring as this 
The last that eer I took her leave at court 
I saw upon her finger 

Hers it was not 

Now  pray you  let me see it  for mine eye 
While I was speaking  oft was fastend tot 
This ring was mine  and  when I gave it Helen 
I bade her  if her fortunes ever stood 
Necessitied to help  that by this token 
I would relieve her  Had you that craft to reave her 
Of what should stead her most 

My gracious sovereign 
Howeer it pleases you to take it so 
The ring was never hers 

Son  on my life 
I have seen her wear it  and she reckond it 
At her lifes rate 

I am sure I saw her wear it 

You are deceivd  my lord  she never saw it 
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me 
Wrappd in a paper  which containd the name 
Of her that threw it  Noble she was  and thought 
I stood engagd  but when I had subscribd 
To mine own fortune  and informd her fully 
I could not answer in that course of honour 
As she had made the overture  she ceasd 
In heavy satisfaction  and would never 
Receive the ring again 

Plutus himself 
That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine 
Hath not in natures mystery more science 
Than I have in this ring  twas mine  twas Helens 
Whoever gave it you  Then  if you know 
That you are well acquainted with yourself 
Confess twas hers  and by what rough enforcement 
You got it from her  She calld the saints to surety 
That she would never put it from her finger 
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed 
Where you have never come  or sent it us 
Upon her great disaster 

She never saw it 

Thou speakst it falsely  as I love mine honour 
And makst conjectural fears to come into me 
Which I would fain shut out  If it should prove 
That thou art so inhuman twill not prove so 
And yet I know not  thou didst hate her deadly 
And she is dead  which nothing  but to close 
Her eyes myself  could win me to believe 
More than to see this ring  Take him away 

My forepast proofs  howeer the matter fall 
Shall tax my fears of little vanity 
Having vainly feard too little  Away with him 
Well sift this matter further 

If you shall prove 
This ring was ever hers  you shall as easy 
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence 
Where yet she never was 


I am wrappd in dismal thinkings 


Gracious sovereign 
Whether I have been to blame or no  I know not 
Heres a petition from a Florentine 
Who hath  for four or five removes come short 
To tender it herself  I undertook it 
Vanquishd thereto by the fair grace and speech 
Of the poor suppliant  who by this I know 
Is here attending  her business looks in her 
With an importing visage  and she told me 
In a sweet verbal brief  it did concern 
Your highness with herself 

Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead  I blush to say it  he won me  Now is the Count Rousillon a widower  his vows are forfeited to me  and my honours paid to him  He stole from Florence  taking no leave  and I follow him to his country for justice  Grant it me  O king  in you it best lies  otherwise a seducer flourishes  and a poor maid is undone  DIANA CAPILET 

I will buy me a soninlaw in a fair  and toll for this  Ill none of him 

The heavens have thought well on thee  Lafeu 
To bring forth this discovery  Seek these suitors 
Go speedily and bring again the count 

I am afeard the life of Helen  lady 
Was foully snatchd 

Now  justice on the doers 


I wonder  sir  sith wives are monsters to you 
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship 
Yet you desire to marry 

What womans that 

I am  my lord  a wretched Florentine 
Derived from the ancient Capilet 
My suit  as I do understand  you know 
And therefore know how far I may be pitied 

I am her mother  sir  whose age and honour 
Both suffer under this complaint we bring 
And both shall cease  without your remedy 

Come hither  county  do you know these women 

My lord  I neither can nor will deny 
But that I know them  do they charge me further 

Why do you look so strange upon your wife 

Shes none of mine  my lord 

If you shall marry 
You give away this hand  and that is mine 
You give away heavens vows  and those are mine 
You give away myself  which is known mine 
For I by vow am so embodied yours 
That she which marries you must marry me 
Either both or none 

Your reputation comes too short for my daughter  you are no husband for her 

My lord  this is a fond and desperate creature 
Whom sometime I have laughd with  let your highness 
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour 
Than for to think that I would sink it here 

Sir  for my thoughts  you have them ill to friend 
Till your deeds gain them  fairer prove your honour 
Than in my thought it lies 

Good my lord 
Ask him upon his oath  if he does think 
He had not my virginity 

What sayst thou to her 

Shes impudent  my lord 
And was a common gamester to the camp 

He does me wrong  my lord  if I were so 
He might have bought me at a common price 
Do not believe him  O  behold this ring 
Whose high respect and rich validity 
Did lack a parallel  yet for all that 
He gave it to a commoner o the camp 
If I be one 

He blushes  and tis it 
Of six preceding ancestors  that gem 
Conferrd by testament to the sequent issue 
Hath it been owd and worn  This is his wife 
That rings a thousand proofs 

Methought you said 
You saw one here in court could witness it 

I did  my lord  but loath am to produce 
So bad an instrument  his names Parolles 

I saw the man today  if man he be 

Find him  and bring him hither 


What of him 
Hes quoted for a most perfidious slave 
With all the spots of the world taxd and deboshd 
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth 
Am I or that or this for what hell utter 
That will speak anything 

She hath that ring of yours 

I think she has  certain it is I likd her 
And boarded her i the wanton way of youth 
She knew her distance and did angle for me 
Madding my eagerness with her restraint 
As all impediments in fancys course 
Are motives of more fancy  and  in fine 
Her infinite cunning  with her modern grace 
Subdued me to her rate  she got the ring 
And I had that which any inferior might 
At marketprice have bought 

I must be patient 
You  that have turnd off a first so noble wife 
May justly diet me  I pray you yet 
Since you lack virtue I will lose a husband 
Send for your ring  I will return it home 
And give me mine again 

I have it not 

What ring was yours  I pray you 

Sir  much like 
The same upon your finger 

Know you this ring  this ring was his of late 

And this was it I gave him  being abed 

The story then goes false you threw it him 
Out of a casement 

I have spoke the truth 


My lord  I do confess the ring was hers 

You boggle shrewdly  every feather starts you 
Is this the man you speak of 

Ay  my lord 

Tell me  sirrah  but tell me true  I charge you 
Not fearing the displeasure of your master 
Which  on your just proceeding Ill keep off 
By him and by this woman here what know you 

So please your majesty  my master hath been an honourable gentleman  tricks he hath had in him  which gentlemen have 

Come  come  to the purpose  did he love this woman 

Faith  sir  he did love her  but how 

How  I pray you 

He did love her  sir  as a gentleman loves a woman 

How is that 

He loved her  sir  and loved her not 

As thou art a knave  and no knave 
What an equivocal companion is this 

I am a poor man  and at your majestys command 

He is a good drum  my lord  but a naughty orator 

Do you know he promised me marriage 

Faith  I know more than Ill speak 

But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest 

Yes  so please your majesty  I did go between them  as I said  but more than that  he loved her  for  indeed  he was mad for her  and talked of Satan  and of limbo  and of Furies  and I know not what  yet I was in that credit with them at that time  that I knew of their going to bed  and of other motions  as promising her marriage  and things which would derive me ill will to speak of  therefore I will not speak what I know 

Thou hast spoken all already  unless thou canst say they are married  but thou art too fine in thy evidence  therefore stand aside  This ring  you say  was yours 

Ay  my good lord 

Where did you buy it  or who gave it you 

It was not given me  nor I did not buy it 

Who lent it you 

It was not lent me neither 

Where did you find it  then 

I found it not 

If it were yours by none of all these ways 
How could you give it him 

I never gave it him 

This womans an easy glove  my lord  she goes off and on at pleasure 

This ring was mine  I gave it his first wife 

It might be yours or hers  for aught I know 

Take her away  I do not like her now 
To prison with her  and away with him 
Unless thou tellst me where thou hadst this ring 
Thou diest within this hour 

Ill never tell you 

Take her away 

Ill put in bail  my liege 

I think thee now some common customer 

By Jove  if ever I knew man  twas you 

Wherefore hast thou accusd him all this while 

Because hes guilty  and he is not guilty 
He knows I am no maid  and hell swear tot 
Ill swear I am a maid  and he knows not 
Great king  I am no strumpet  by my life 
I am either maid  or else this old mans wife 


She does abuse our ears  to prison with her 

Good mother  fetch my bail 

Stay  royal sir 
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for 
And he shall surety me  But for this lord 
Who hath abusd me  as he knows himself 
Though yet he never harmd me  here I quit him 
He knows himself my bed he hath defild 
And at that time he got his wife with child 
Dead though she be  she feels her young one kick 
So theres my riddle  one thats dead is quick 
And now behold the meaning 


Is there no exorcist 
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes 
Ist real that I see 

No  my good lord 
Tis but the shadow of a wife you see 
The name and not the thing 

Both  both  O  pardon 

O my good lord  when I was like this maid 
I found you wondrous kind  There is your ring 
And  look you  heres your letter  this it says 
When from my finger you can get this ring 
And are by me with child   c  This is done 
Will you be mine  now you are doubly won 

If she  my liege  can make me know this clearly 
Ill love her dearly  ever  ever dearly 

If it appear not plain  and prove untrue 
Deadly divorce step between me and you 
O  my dear mother  do I see you living 

Mine eyes smell onions  I shall weep anon 

Good Tom Drum  lend me a handkercher  so  I thank thee  Wait on me home  Ill make sport with thee  let thy curtsies alone  they are scurvy ones 

Let us from point to point this story know 
To make the even truth in pleasure flow 


If thou best yet a fresh uncropped flower 
Choose thou thy husband  and Ill pay thy dower 
For I can guess that by thy honest aid 
Thou keptst a wife herself  thyself a maid 
Of that  and all the progress  more and less 
Resolvedly more leisure shall express 
All yet seems well  and if it end so meet 
The bitter past  more welcome is the sweet 

Spoken by the The kings a beggar  now the play is done 
All is well ended if this suit be won 
That you express content  which we will pay 
With strife to please you  day exceeding day 
Ours be your patience then  and yours our parts 
Your gentle hands lend us  and take our hearts
