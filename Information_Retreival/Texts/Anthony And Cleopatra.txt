ANTHONY AND CLEOPATRA

Nay  but this dotage of our generals 
Oerflows the measure  those his goodly eyes 
That oer the files and musters of the war 
Have glowd like plated Mars  now bend  now turn 
The office and devotion of their view 
Upon a tawny front  his captains heart 
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst 
The buckles on his breast  reneges all temper 
And is become the bellows and the fan 
To cool a gipsys lust  Look  where they come 


Take but good note  and you shall see in him 
The triple pillar of the world transformd 

Into a strumpets fool  behold and see 

If it be love indeed  tell me how much 

Theres beggary in the love that can be reckond 

Ill set a bourn how far to be belovd 

Then must thou needs find out new heaven  new earth 


News  my good lord  from Rome 

Grates me  the sum 

Nay  hear them  Antony 
Fulvia  perchance  is angry  or  who knows 
If the scarcebearded C sar have not sent 
His powerful mandate to you  Do this  or this 
Take in that kingdom  and enfranchise that 
Perform t  or else we damn thee  

How  my love 

Perchance  nay  and most like 
You must not stay here longer  your dismission 
Is come from C sar  therefore hear it  Antony 
Wheres Fulvias process  C sars I would say  both 
Call in the messengers  As I am Egypts queen 
Thou blushest  Antony  and that blood of thine 
Is C sars homager  else so thy cheek pays shame 
When shrilltongud Fulvia scolds  The messengers 

Let Rome in Tiber melt  and the wide arch 
Of the rangd empire fall  Here is my space 
Kingdoms are clay  our dungy earth alike 
Feeds beast as man  the nobleness of life 
Is to do thus  when such a mutual pair 

And such a twain can do t  in which I bind 
On pain of punishment  the world to weet 
We stand up peerless 

Excellent falsehood 
Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her 
Ill seem the fool I am not  Antony 
Will be himself 

But stirrd by Cleopatra 
Now  for the love of Love and her soft hours 
Lets not confound the time with conference harsh 
Theres not a minute of our lives should stretch 
Without some pleasure now  What sport tonight 

Hear the ambassadors 

Fie  wrangling queen 
Whom every thing becomes  to chide  to laugh 
To weep  whose every passion fully strives 
To make itself  in thee  fair and admird 
No messenger  but thine  and all alone 
Tonight well wander through the streets and note 
The qualities of people  Come  my queen 
Last night you did desire it  speak not to us 


Is C sar with Antonius prizd so slight 

Sir  sometimes  when he is not Antony 
He comes too short of that great property 
Which still should go with Antony 

I am full sorry 
That he approves the common liar  who 
Thus speaks of him at Rome  but I will hope 
Of better deeds tomorrow  Rest you happy 


Lord Alexas  sweet Alexas  most any thing Alexas  almost most absolute Alexas  wheres the soothsayer that you praised so to the queen  O  that I knew this husband  which  you say  must charge his horns with garlands 

Soothsayer 

Your will 

Is this the man  Ist you  sir  that know things 

In natures infinite book of secrecy 
A little I can read 

Show him your hand 


Bring in the banquet quickly  wine enough 
Cleopatras health to drink 

Good sir  give me good fortune 

I make not  but foresee 

Pray then  foresee me one 

You shall be yet far fairer than you are 

He means in flesh 

No  you shall paint when you are old 

Wrinkles forbid 

Vex not his prescience  be attentive 

Hush 

You shall be more beloving than belovd 

I had rather heat my liver with drinking 

Nay  hear him 

Good now  some excellent fortune  Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon  and widow them all  let me have a child at fifty  to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage  find me to marry me with Octavius C sar  and companion me with my mistress 

You shall outlive the lady whom you serve 

O excellent  I love long life better than figs 

You have seen and provd a fairer former fortune 
Than that which is to approach 

Then  belike  my children shall have no names  prithee  how many boys and wenches must I have 

If every of your wishes had a womb 
And fertile every wish  a million 

Out  fool  I forgive thee for a witch 

You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes 

Nay  come  tell Iras hers 

Well know all our fortunes 

Mine  and most of our fortunes  tonight  shall be drunk to bed 

Theres a palm presages chastity  if nothing else 

Een as the overflowing Nilus presageth famine 

Go  you wild bedfellow  you cannot soothsay 

Nay  if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication  I cannot scratch mine ear 
Prithee  tell her but a workyday fortune 

Your fortunes are alike 

But how  but how  give me particulars 

I have said 

Am I not an inch of fortune better than she 

Well  if you were but an inch of fortune better than I  where would you choose it 

Not in my husbands nose 

Our worser thoughts heaven mend  Alexas come  his fortune  his fortune  O  let him marry a woman that cannot go  sweet Isis  I beseech thee  and let her die too  and give him a worse  and let worse follow worse  till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave  fiftyfold a cuckold  Good Isis  hear me this prayer  though thou deny me a matter of more weight  good Isis  I beseech thee 

Amen  Dear goddess  hear that prayer of the people  for  as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loosewived  so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded  therefore  dear Isis  keep decorum  and fortune him accordingly 

Amen 

Lo  now  if it lay in their hands to make me acuckold  they would make themselves whores  but theyd dot 

Hush  here comes Antony 

Not he  the queen 


Saw you my lord 

No  lady 

Was he not here 

No  madam 

He was disposd to mirth  but on the sudden 
A Roman thought hath struck him  Enobarbus 

Madam 

Seek him  and bring him hither  Wheres Alexas 

Here  at your service  My lord approaches 


We will not look upon him  go with us 


Fulvia thy wife first came into the field 

Against my brother Lucius 

Ay 
But soon that war had end  and the times state 
Made friends of them  jointing their force gainst C sar 
Whose better issue in the war  from Italy 
Upon the first encounter drave them 

Well  what worst 

The nature of bad news infects the teller 

When it concerns the fool  or coward  On 
Things that are past are done with me  Tis thus 
Who tells me true  though in his tale lay death 
I hear him as he flatterd 

Labienus 
This is stiff news hath  with his Parthian force 
Extended Asia  from Euphrates 
His conquering banner shook from Syria 
To Lydia and to Ionia  whilst 

Antony  thou wouldst say 

O  my lord 

Speak to me home  mince not the general tongue 
Name Cleopatra as she is calld in Rome 
Rail thou in Fulvias phrase  and taunt my faults 
With such full licence as both truth and malice 
Have power to utter  O  then we bring forth weeds 
When our quick winds lie still  and our ills told us 
Is as our earing  Fare thee well awhile 

At your noble pleasure 


From Sicyon  ho  the news  Speak there 

The man from Sicyon  is there such an one 

He stays upon your will 

Let him appear 
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break 
Or lose myself in dotage 

What are you 

Fulvia thy wife is dead 

Where died she 

In Sicyon 
Her length of sickness  with what else more serious 
Importeth thee to know  this bears 


Forbear me 

Theres a great spirit gone  Thus did I desire it 
What our contempts do often hurl from us 
We wish it ours again  the present pleasure 
By revolution lowering  does become 
The opposite of itself  shes good  being gone 
The hand could pluck her back that shovd her on 
I must from this enchanting queen break off 
Ten thousand harms  more than the ills I know 
My idleness doth hatch  How now  Enobarbus 


Whats your pleasure  sir 

I must with haste from hence 

Why  then  we kill all our women  We see how mortal an unkindness is to them  if they suffer our departure  deaths the word 

I must be gone 

Under a compelling occasion let women die  it were pity to cast them away for nothing  though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing  Cleopatra  catching but the least noise of this  dies instantly  I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment  I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her  she hath such a celerity in dying 

She is cunning past mans thought 

Alack  sir  no  her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love  We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears  they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report  this cannot be cunning in her  if it be  she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove 

Would I had never seen her 

O  sir  you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blessed withal would have discredited your travel 

Fulvia is dead 

Sir 

Fulvia is dead 

Fulvia 

Dead 

Why  sir  give the gods a thankful sacrifice  When it pleaseth their de ties to take the wife of a man from him  it shows to man the tailors of the earth  comforting therein  that when old robes are worn out  there are members to make new  If there were no more women but Fulvia  then had you indeed a cut  and the case to be lamented  this grief is crowned with consolation  your old smock brings forth a new petticoat  and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow 

The business she hath broached in the state 
Cannot endure my absence 

And the business you have broached here cannot be without you  especially that of Cleopatras  which wholly depends on your abode 

No more light answers  Let our officers Have notice what we purpose  I shall break 
The cause of our expedience to the queen 
And get her leave to part  For not alone 
The death of Fulvia  with more urgent touches 
Do strongly speak to us  but the letters too 
Of many our contriving friends in Rome 
Petition us at home  Sextus Pompeius 
Hath given the dare to C sar  and commands 
The empire of the sea  our slippery people 
Whose love is never linkd to the deserver 
Till his deserts are past begin to throw 
Pompey the Great and all his dignities 
Upon his son  who  high in name and power 
Higher than both in blood and life  stands up 
For the main soldier  whose quality  going on 
The sides o the world may danger  Much is breeding 
Which  like the coursers hair  hath yet but life 
And not a serpents poison  Say  our pleasure 
To such whose place is under us  requires 
Our quick remove from hence 

I shall do it 


Where is he 

I did not see him since 

See where he is  whos with him  what he does 
I did not send you  if you find him sad 
Say I am dancing  if in mirth  report 
That I am sudden sick  quick  and return 


Madam  methinks  if you did love him dearly 
You do not hold the method to enforce 
The like from him 

What should I do I do not 

In each thing give him way  cross him in nothing 

Thou teachest like a fool  the way to lose him 

Tempt him not so too far  I wish  forbear 
In time we hate that which we often fear 
But here comes Antony 


I am sick and sullen 

I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose 

Help me away  dear Charmian  I shall fall 
It cannot be thus long  the sides of nature 
Will not sustain it 

Now  my dearest queen 

Pray you  stand further from me 

Whats the matter 

I know  by that same eye  theres some good news 
What says the married woman  You may go 
Would she had never given you leave to come 
Let her not say tis I that keep you here 
I have no power upon you  hers you are 

The gods best know 

O  never was there queen 
So mightily betrayd  yet at the first 
I saw the treasons planted 

Cleopatra 

Why should I think you can be mine and true 
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods 
Who have been false to Fulvia  Riotous madness 
To be entangled with those mouthmade vows 
Which break themselves in swearing 

Most sweet queen 

Nay  pray you  seek no colour for your going 
But bid farewell  and go  when you sud staying 
Then was the time for words  no going then 
Eternity was in our lips and eyes 
Bliss in our brows bent  none our parts so poor 
But was a race of heaven  they are so still 
Or thou  the greatest soldier of the world 
Art turnd the greatest liar 

How now  lady 

I would I had thy inches  thou shouldst know 
There were a heart in Egypt 

Hear me  queen 
The strong necessity of time commands 
Our services awhile  but my full heart 
Remains in use with you  Our Italy 
Shines oer with civil swords  Sextus Pompeius 
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome 
Equality of two domestic powers 
Breeds scrupulous faction  The hated  grown to strength 
Are newly grown to love  the condemnd Pompey 
Rich in his fathers honour  creeps apace 
Into the hearts of such as have not thrivd 
Upon the present state  whose numbers threaten 
And quietness  grown aick of rest  would purge 
By any desperate change  My more particular 
And that which most with you should safe my going 
Is Fulvias death 

Though age from folly could not give me freedom 
It does from childishness  can Fulvia die 

Shes dead  my queen 
Look here  and at thy sovereign leisure read 
The garboils she awakd  at the last  best 
See when and where she died 

O most false love 
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill 
With sorrowful water  Now I see  I see 
In Fulvias death  how mine receivd shall be 

Quarrel no more  but be prepard to know 
The purposes I bear  which are or cease 
As you shall give the advice  By the fire 
That quickens Nilus slime  I go from hence 
Thy soldier  servant  making peace or war 
As thou affectst 

Cut my lace  Charmian  come 
But let it be  I am quickly ill  and well 
So Antony loves 

My precious queen  forbear 
And give true evidence to his love which stands 
An honourable trial 

So Fulvia told me 
I prithee  turn aside and weep for her 
Then bid adieu to me  and say the tears 
Belong to Egypt  good now  play one scene 
Of excellent dissembling  and let it look 
Like perfect honour 

Youll heat my blood  no more 

You can do better yet  but this is meetly 

Now  by my sword 

And target  Still he mends 
But this is not the best  Look  prithee  Charmian 
How this Herculean Roman does become 
The carriage of his chafe 

Ill leave you  lady 

Courteous lord  one word 
Sir  you and I must part  but that s not it 
Sir  you and I have lovd  but there s not it 
That you know well  something it is I would 
O  my oblivion is a very Antony 
And I am all forgotten 

But that your royalty 
Holds idleness your subject  I should take you 
For idleness itself 

Tis sweating labour 
To bear such idleness so near the heart 
As Cleopatra this  But  sir  forgive me 
Since my becomings kill me when they do not 
Eye well to you  your honour calls you hence 
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly 
And all the gods go with you  Upon your sword 
Sit laurel victory  and smooth success 
Be strewd before your feet 

Let us go  Come 
Our separation so abides and flies 
That thou  residing here  gost yet with me 
And I  hence fleeting  here remain with thee 
Away 


You may see  Lepidus  and henceforth know 
It is not C sars natural vice to hate 
Our great competitor  From Alexandria 
This is the news  he fishes  drinks  and wastes 
The lamps of night in revel  is not more manlike 
Than Cleopatra  nor the queen of Ptolemy 
More womanly than he  hardly gave audience  or 
Vouchsafd to think he had partners  you shall find there 
A man who is the abstract of all faults 
That all men follow 

I must not think there are 
Evils enow to darken all his goodness 
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven 
More fiery by nights blackness  hereditary 
Rather than purchasd  what he cannot change 
Than what he chooses 

You are too indulgent  Let us grant it is not 
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy 
To give a kingdom for a mirth  to sit 
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave 
To reel the streets at noon  and stand the buffet 
With knaves that smell of sweat  say this becomes him 
As his composure must be rare indeed 
Whom these things cannot blemish yet must Antony 
No way excuse his soils  when we do bear 
So great weight in his lightness  If he filld 
His vacancy with his voluptuousness 
Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones 
Call on him for t  but to confound such time 
That drums him from his sport  and speaks as loud 
As his own state and ours  tis to be chid 
As we rate boys  who  being mature in knowledge 
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure 
And so rebel to judgment 


Heres more news 

Thy biddings have been done  and every hour 
Most noble C sar  shalt thou have report 
How tis abroad  Pompey is strong at sea 
And it appears he is belovd of those 
That only have feard C sar  to the ports 
The discontents repair  and mens reports 
Give him much wrongd 

I should have known no less 
It hath been taught us from the primal state 
That he which is was wishd until he were 
And the ebbd man  neer lovd till neer worth love 
Comes deard by being lackd  This common body 
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream 
Goes to and back  lackeying the varying tide 
To rot itself with motion 

C sar  I bring thee word 
Menecrates and Menas  famous pirates 
Make the sea serve them  which they ear and wound 
With keels of every kind  many hot inroads 
They make in Italy  the borders maritime 
Lack blood to think ont  and flush youth revolt 
No vessel can peep forth  but tis as soon 
Taken as seen  for Pompeys name strikes more 
Than could his war resisted 

Antony 
Leave thy lascivious wassails  When thou once 
Wast beaten from Modena  where thou slewst 
Hirtius and Pansa  consuls  at thy heel 
Did famine follow  whom thou foughtst against 
Though daintily brought up  with patience more 
Than savages could suffer  thou didst drink 
The stale of horses and the gilded puddle 
Which beasts would cough at  thy palate then did deign 
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge 
Yea  like the stag  when snow the pasture sheets 
The barks of trees thou browsedst  on the Alps 
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh 
Which some did die to look on  and all this 
It wounds thy honour that I speak it now 
Was borne so like a soldier  that thy cheek 
So much as lankd not 

Tis pity of him 

Let his shames quickly 
Drive him to Rome  Tis time we twain 
Did show ourselves i the field  and to that end 
Assemble me immediate council  Pompey 
Thrives in our idleness 

Tomorrow  C sar 
I shall be furnishd to inform you rightly 
Both what by sea and land I can be able 
To front this present time 

Till which encounter 
It is my business too  Farewell 

Farewell  my lord  What you shall know meantime 
Of stirs abroad  I shall beseech you  sir 
To let me be partaker 

Doubt not  sir 
I knew it for my bond 


Charmian 

Madam 

Ha  ha 
Give me to drink mandragora 

Why  madam 

That I might sleep out this great gap of time 
My Antony is away 

You think of him too much 

O  tis treason 

Madam  I trust  not so 

Thou  eunuch Mardian 

What s your highness pleasure 

Not now to hear thee sing  I take no pleasure 
In aught a eunuch has  Tis well for thee 
That  being unseminard  thy freer thoughts 
May not fly forth of Egypt  Hast thou affections 

Yes  gracious madam 

Indeed 

Not in deed  madam  for I can do nothing 
But what in deed is honest to be done 
Yet have I fierce affections  and think 
What Venus did with Mars 

O Charmian 
Where thinkst thou he is now  Stands he  or sits he 
Or does he walk  or is he on his horse 
O happy horse  to bear the weight of Antony 
Do bravely  horse  for wotst thou whom thou movst 
The demiAtlas of this earth  the arm 
And burgonet of men  Hes speaking now 
Or murmuring Wheres my serpent of old Nile  
For so he calls me  Now I feed myself 
With most delicious poison  Think on me 
That am with Ph bus amorous pinches black 
And wrinkled deep in time  Broadfronted C sar 
When thou wast here above the ground I was 
A morsel for a monarch  and great Pompey 
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow 
There would he anchor his aspect and die 
With looking on his life 


Sovereign of Egypt  hail 

How much unlike art thou Mark Antony 
Yet  coming from him  that great medicine hath 
With his tinct gilded thee 
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony 

Last thing he did  dear queen 
He kissd  the last of many doubled kisses 
This orient pearl  His speech sticks in my heart 

Mine ear must pluck it thence 

Good friend  quoth he 
Say  the firm Roman to great Egypt sends 
This treasure of an oyster  at whose foot 
To mend the petty present  I will piece 
Her opulent throne with kingdoms  all the east 
Say thou  shall call her mistress  So he nodded 
And soberly did mount an armgaunt steed 
Who neighd so high that what I would have spoke 
Was beastly dumbd by him 

What  was he sad or merry 

Like to the time o the year between the extremes 
Of hot and cold  he was nor sad nor merry 

O welldivided disposition  Note him 
Note him  good Charmian  tis the man  but note him 
He was not sad  for he would shire on those 
That make their looks by his  he was not merry 
Which seemd to tell them his remembrance lay 
In Egypt with his joy  but between both 
O heavenly mingle  Best thou sad or merry 
The violence of either thee becomes 
So does it no man else  Mettst thou my posts 

Ay  madam  twenty several messengers 
Why do you send so thick 

Whos born that day 
When I forget to send to Antony 
Shall die a beggar  Ink and paper  Charmian 
Welcome  my good Alexas  Did I  Charmian 
Ever love C sar so 

O  that brave C sar 

Be chokd with such another emphasis 
Say the brave Antony 

The valiant C sar 

By Isis  I will give thee bloody teeth 
If thou with C sar paragon again 
My man of men 

By your most gracious pardon 
I sing but after you 

My salad days 
When I was green in judgment  cold in blood 
To say as I said then  But come  away 
Get me ink and paper 
He shall have every day a several greeting 
Or Ill unpeople Egypt 

If the great gods be just  they shall assist 
The deeds of justest men 

Know  worthy Pompey 
That what they do delay  they not deny 

Whiles we are suitors to their throne  decays 
The thing we sue for 

We  ignorant of ourselves 
Beg often our own harms  which the wise powers 
Deny us for our good  so find we profit 
By losing of our prayers 

I shall do well 
The people love me  and the sea is mine 
My powers are crescent  and my auguring hope 
Says it will come to the full  Mark Antony 
In Egypt sits at dinner  and will make 
No wars without doors  C sar gets money where 
He loses hearts  Lepidus flatters both 
Of both is flatterd  but he neither loves 
Nor either cares for him 

C sar and Lepidus 
Are in the field  a mighty strength they carry 

Where have you this  tis false 

From Silvius  sir 

He dreams  I know they are in Rome together 
Looking for Antony  But all the charms of love 
Salt Cleopatra  soften thy wand lip 
Let witchcraft join with beauty  lust with both 
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts 
Keep his brain fuming  Epicurean cooks 
Sharpen with cloyless sance his appetite 
That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour 
Even till a Lethed dulness 

How now  Varrius 

This is most certain that I shall deliver 
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome 
Expected  since he went from Egypt tis 
A space for further travel 

I could have given less matter 
A better ear  Menas  I did not think 
This amorous surfeiter would have donnd his helm 
For such a petty war  his soldiership 
Is twice the other twain  But let us rear 
The higher our opinion  that our stirring 
Can from the lap of Egypts widow pluck 
The neerlustwearied Antony 

I cannot hope 
C sar and Antony shall well greet together 
His wife thats dead did trespasses to C sar 
His brother warrd upon him  although I think 
Not movd by Antony 

I know not  Menas 
How lesser enmities may give way to greater 
Were t not that we stand up against them all 
Twere pregnant they should square between themselves 
For they have entertained cause enough 
To draw their swords  but how the fear of us 
May cement their divisions and bind up 
The petty difference  we yet not know 
Be it as our gods will have t  It only stands 
Our lives upon  to use our strongest hands 
Come  Menas 


Good Enobarbus  tis a worthy deed 
And shall become you well  to entreat your captain 
To soft and gentle speech 

I shall entreat him 
To answer like himself  if C sar move him 
Let Antony look over C sars head 
And speak as loud as Mars  By Jupiter 
Were I the wearer of Antonius beard 
I would not shave t today 

Tis not a time 
For private stomaching 

Every time 
Serves for the matter that is then born in t 

But small to greater matters must give way 

Not if the small come first 

Your speech is passion 
But  pray you  stir no embers up  Here comes 
The noble Antony 


And yonder  C sar 


If we compose well here  to Parthia 
Hark ye  Ventidius 

I do not know 
Mec nas  ask Agrippa 

Noble friends 
That which combind us was most great  and let not 
A leaner action rend us  Whats amiss 
May it be gently heard  when we debate 
Our trivial difference loud  we do commit 
Murder in healing wounds  then  noble partners 
The rather for I earnestly beseech 
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms 
Nor curstness grow to the matter 

Tis spoken well 
Were we before our armies  and to fight 
I should do thus 

Welcome to Rome 

Thank you 

Sit 

Sit  sir 

Nay  then 

I learn  you take things ill which are not so 
Or being  concern you not 

I must be laughd at 
If  or for nothing or a little  I 
Should say myself offended  and with you 
Chiefly i the world  more laughd at that I should 
Once name you derogately  when to sound your name 
It not concernd me 

My being in Egypt  C sar 
What was t to you 

No more than my residing here at Rome 
Might be to you in Egypt  yet  if you there 
Did practise on my state  your being in Egypt 
Might be my question 

How intend you  practisd 

You may be pleasd to catch at mine intent 
By what did here befall me  Your wife and brother 
Made wars upon me  and their contestation 
Was theme for you  you were the word of war 

You do mistake your business  my brother never 
Did urge me in his act  I did inquire it 
And have my learning from some true reports 
That drew their swords with you  Did he not rather 
Discredit my authority with yours 
And make the wars alike against my stomach 
Having alike your cause  Of this my letters 
Before did satisfy you  If youll patch a quarrel 
As matter whole you n have to make it with 
It must not be with this 

You praise yourself 
By laying defects of judgment to me  but 
You patchd up your excuses 

Not so  not so 
I know you could not lack  I am certain on t 
Very necessity of this thought  that I 
Your partner in the cause gainst which he fought 
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars 
Which fronted mine own peace  As for my wife 
I would you had her spirit in such another 
The third o the world is yours  which with a snaffle 
You may pace easy  but not such a wife 

Would we had all such wives  that the men might go to wars with the women 

So much uncurbable  her garboils  C sar 
Made out of her impatience which not wanted 
Shrewdness of policy too I grieving grant 
Did you too much disquiet  for that you must 
But say I could not help it 

I wrote to you 
When rioting in Alexandria  you 
Did pocket up my letters  and with taunts 
Did gibe my missive out of audience 

Sir 
He fell upon me  ere admitted  then 
Three kings I had newly feasted  and did want 
Of what I was i the morning  but next day 
I told him of myself  which was as much 
As to have askd him pardon  Let this fellow 
Be nothing of our strife  if we contend 
Out of our question wipe him 

You have broken 
The article of your oath  which you shall never 
Have tongue to charge me with 

Soft  C sar 

No 
Lepidus  let him speak 
The honours sacred which he talks on now 
Supposing that I lackd it  But on  C sar 
The article of my oath 

To lend me arms and aid when I requird them 
The which you both denied 

Neglected  rather 
And then  when poisond hours had bound me up 
From mine own knowledge  As nearly as I may 
Ill play the penitent to you  but mine honesty 
Shall not make poor my greatness  nor my power 
Work without it  Truth is  that Fulvia 
To have me out of Egypt  made wars here 
For which myself  the ignorant motive  do 
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour 
To stoop in such a case 

Tis noble spoken 

If it might please you  to enforce no further 
The griefs between ye  to forget them quite 
Were to remember that the present need 
Speaks to atone you 

Worthily spoken  Mec nas 

Or  if you borrow one anothers love for the instant  you may  when you hear no more words of Pompey  return it again  you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do 

Thou art a soldier only  speak no more 

That truth should be silent I had almost forgot 

You wrong this presence  therefore speak no more 

Go to  then  your considerate stone 

I do not much dislike the matter  but 
The manner of his speech  for it cannot be 
We shall remain in friendship  our conditions 
So differing in their acts  Yet  if I knew 
What hoop should hold us stanch  from edge to edge 
O the world I would pursue it 

Give me leave  C sar 

Speak  Agrippa 

Thou hast a sister by the mothers side 
Admird Octavia  great Mark Antony 
Is now a widower 

Say not so  Agrippa 
If Cleopatra heard you  your reproof 
Were well deservd of rashness 

I am not married  C sar  let me hear 
Agrippa further speak 

To hold you in perpetual amity 
To make you brothers  and to knit your hearts 
With an unslipping knot  take Antony 
Octavia to his wife  whose beauty claims 
No worse a husband than the best of men 
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak 
That which none else can utter  By this marriage 
All little jealousies which now seem great 
And all great fears which now import their dangers 
Would then be nothing  truths would be but tales 
Where now half tales be truths  her love to both 
Would each to other and all loves to both 
Draw after her  Pardon what I have spoke 
For tis a studied  not a present thought 
By duty ruminated 

Will C sar speak 

Not till he hears how Antony is touchd 
With what is spoke already 

What power is in Agrippa 
If I would say  Agrippa  be it so  
To make this good 

The power of C sar  and 
His power unto Octavia 

May I never 
To this good purpose  that so fairly shows 
Dream of impediment  Let me have thy hand 
Further this act of grace  and from this hour 
The heart of brothers govern in our loves 
And sway our great designs 

There is my hand 
A sister I bequeath you  whom no brother 
Did ever love so dearly  let her live 
To join our kingdoms and our hearts  and never 
Fly off our loves again 

Happily  amen 

I did not think to draw my sword gainst Pompey 
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great 
Of late upon me  I must thank him only 
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report 
At heel of that  defy him 

Time calls upon s 
Of us must Pompey presently be sought 
Or else he seeks out us 

Where lies he 

About the Mount Misenum 

Whats his strength 
By land 

Great and increasing  but by sea 
He is an absolute master 

So is the fame 
Would we had spoke together  Haste we for it 
Yet  ere we put ourselves in arms  dispatch we 
The business we have talkd of 

With most gladness 
And do invite you to my sisters view 
Whither straight Ill lead you 

Let us  Lepidus 
Not lack your company 

Noble Antony 
Not sickness should detain me 


Welcome from Egypt  sir 

Half the heart of C sar  worthy Mec nas  My honourable friend  Agrippa 

Good Enobarbus 

We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested  You stayed well by t in 
Egypt 

Ay  sir  we did sleep day out of countenance  and made the night light with drinking 

Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast  and but twelve persons there  is this true 

This was but as a fly by an eagle  we had much more monstrous matter of feast  which worthily deserved noting 

Shes a most triumphant lady  if report be square to her 

When she first met Mark Antony she pursed up his heart  upon the river of Cydnus 

There she appeared indeed  or my reporter devised well for her 

I will tell you 
The barge she sat in  like a burnishd throne 
Burnd on the water  the poop was beaten gold 
Purple the sails  and so perfumed  that 
The winds were lovesick with them  the oars were silver 
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke  and made 
The water which they beat to follow faster 
As amorous of their strokes  For her own person 
It beggard all description  she did lie 
In her pavilion clothofgold of tissue 
Oerpicturing that Venus where we see 
The fancy outwork nature  on each side her 
Stood prettydimpled boys  like smiling Cupids 
With diverscolourd fans  whose wind did seem 
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool 
And what they undid did 

O  rare for Antony 

Her gentlewomen  like the Nereides 
So many mermaids  tended her i the eyes 
And made their bends adornings  at the helm 
A seeming mermaid steers  the silken tackle 
Swell with the touches of those flowersoft hands 
That yarely frame the office  From the barge 
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense 
Of the adjacent wharfs  The city cast 
Her people out upon her  and Antony 
Enthrond i the marketplace  did sit alone 
Whistling to the air  which  but for vacancy 
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too 
And made a gap in nature 

Rare Egyptian 

Upon her landing  Antony sent to her 
Invited her to supper  she replied 
It should be better he became her guest 
Which she entreated  Our courteous Antony 
Whom neer the word of No woman heard speak 
Being barberd ten times oer  goes to the feast 
And  for his ordinary pays his heart 
For what his eyes eat only 

Royal wench 
She made great C sar lay his sword to bed 
He ploughd her  and she croppd 

I saw her once 
Hop forty paces through the public street 
And having lost her breath  she spoke  and panted 
That she did make defect perfection 
And  breathless  power breathe forth 

Now Antony must leave her utterly 

Never  he will not 
Age cannot wither her  nor custom stale 
Her infinite variety  other women cloy 
The appetites they feed  but she makes hungry 
Where most she satisfies  for vilest things 
Become themselves in her  that the holy priests 
Bless her when she is riggish 

If beauty  wisdom  modesty  can settle 
The heart of Antony  Octavia is 
A blessed lottery to him 

Let us go 
Good Enobarbus  make yourself my guest 
Whilst you abide here 

Humbly  sir  I thank you 


The world and my great office will sometimes 
Divide me from your bosom 

All which time 
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers 
To them for you 

Good night  sir  My Octavia 
Read not my blemishes in the worlds report 
I have not kept my square  but that to come 
Shall all be done by the rule  Good night  dear lady 

Good night  sir 

Good night 

Now  sirrah  you do wish yourself in Egypt 

Would I had never come from thence  nor you 
Thither 

If you can  your reason 

I see it in 
My motion  have it not in my tongue  but yet 
Hie you to Egypt again 

Say to me 
Whose fortunes shall rise higher  C sars or mine 

C sars 
Therefore  O Antony  stay not by his side 
Thy demon thats thy spirit which keeps thee is 
Noble  courageous  high  unmatchable 
Where C sars is not  but near him thy angel 
Becomes a fear  as being oerpowerd  therefore 
Make space enough between you 

Speak this no more 

To none but thee  no more but when to thee 
If thou dost play with him at any game 
Thou art sure to lose  and  of that natural luck 
He beats thee gainst the odds  thy lustre thickens 
When he shines by  I say again  thy spirit 
Is all afraid to govern thee near him 
But he away  tis noble 

Get thee gone 
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him 

He shall to Parthia  Be it art or hap 
He hath spoken true  the very dice obey him 
And in our sports my better cunning faints 
Under his chance  if we draw lots he speeds 
His cocks do win the battle still of mine 
When it is all to nought  and his quails ever 
Beat mine  inhoopd  at odds  I will to Egypt 
And though I make this marriage for my peace 
I the east my pleasure lies 


O  come  Ventidius 
You must to Parthia  your commissions ready 
Follow me  and receive t 

Trouble yourselves no further  pray you hasten 
Your generals after 

Sir  Mark Antony 
Will een but kiss Octavia  and well follow 

Till I shall see you in your soldiers dress 
Which will become you both  farewell 

We shall 
As I conceive the journey  be at the Mount 
Before you  Lepidus 

Your way is shorter 
My purposes to draw me much about 
You ll win two days upon me 

Sir  good success 

Sir  good success 

Farewell 


Give me some music  music  moody food 
Of us that trade in love 

The music  ho 


Let it alone  let s to billiards  come  Charmian 

My arm is sore  best play with Mardian 

As well a woman with a eunuch playd 
As with a woman  Come  you ll play with me  sir 

As well as I can  madam 

And when good will is showd  thought come too short 
The actor may plead pardon  I ll none now 
Give me mine angle  well to the river  there 
My music playing far off I will betray 
Tawnyfinnd fishes  my bended hook shall pierce 
Their slimy jaws  and  as I draw them up 
Ill think them every one an Antony 
And say  Ah  ha  youre caught 

Twas merry when 
You wagerd on your angling  when your diver 
Did hang a saltfish on his hook  which he 
With fervency drew up 

That time O times 
I laughd him out of patience  and that night 
I laughd him into patience  and next morn 
Ere the ninth hour  I drunk him to his bed 
Then put my tires and mantles on him  whilst 
I wore his sword Philippan 


O  from Italy 
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears 

That long time have been barren 

Madam  madam 

Antonys dead  if thou say so  villain 
Thou killst thy mistress  but well and free 
If thou so yield him  there is gold  and here 
My bluest veins to kiss  a hand that kings 
Have lippd  and trembled kissing 

First  madam  he is well 

Why  theres more gold 
But  sirrah  mark  we use 
To say the dead are well  bring it to that 
The gold I give thee will I melt  and pour 
Down thy illuttering throat 

Good madam  hear me 

Well  go to  I will 
But theres no goodness in thy face  if Antony 
Be free and healthful  so tart a favour 
To trumpet such good tidings  if not well 
Thou shouldst come like a Fury crownd with snakes 
Not like a formal man 

Willt please you hear me 

I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speakst 
Yet  if thou say Antony lives  is well 
Or friends with C sar  or not captive to him 
Ill set thee in a shower of gold  and hail 
Rich pearls upon thee 

Madam  hes well 

Well said 

And friends with C sar 

Thourt an honest man 

C sar and he are greater friends than ever 

Make thee a fortune from me 

But yet  madam 

I do not like but yet  it does allay 
The good precedence  fie upon but yet  
But yet is as a gaoler to bring forth 
Some monstrous malefactor  Prithee  friend 
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear 
The good and bad together  Hes friends with C sar 
In state of health  thou sayst  and thou sayst  free 

Free  madam  no  I made no such report 
Hes bound unto Octavia 

For what good turn 

For the best turn i the bed 

I am pale  Charmian 

Madam  hes married to Octavia 

The most infectious pestilence upon thee 


Good madam  patience 

What say you  Hence 

Horrible villain  or Ill spurn thine eyes 
Like balls before me  Ill unhair thy head 

Thou shalt be whippd with wire  and stewd in brine 
Smarting in lingering pickle 

Gracious madam 
I  that do bring the news made not the match 

Say tis not so  a province I will give thee 
And make thy fortunes proud  the blow thou hadst 
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage 
And I will boot thee with what gift beside 
Thy modesty can beg 

Hes married  madam 

Rogue  thou hast livd too long 


Nay  then Ill run 
What mean you  madam  I have made no fault 


Good madam  keep yourself within yourself 
The man is innocent 

Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt 
Melt Egypt into Nile  and kindly creatures 
Turn all to serpents  Call the slave again 
Though I am mad  I will not bite him  Call 

He is afeard to come 

I will not hurt him 

These hands do lack nobility  that they strike 
A meaner than myself  since I myself 
Have given myself the cause 


Come hither  sir 
Though it be honest  it is never good 
To bring bad news  give to a gracious message 
A host of tongues  but let ill tidings tell 

Themselves when they be felt 

I have done my duty 

Is he married 
I cannot hate thee worser than I do 
If thou again say Yes  

Hes married  madam 

The gods confound thee  dost thou hold there still 

Should I lie  madam 

O  I would thou didst 
So half my Egypt were submergd and made 
A cistern for scald snakes  Go  get thee hence 
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face  to me 
Thou wouldst appear most ugly  He is married 

I crave your highness pardon 

He is married 

Take no offence that I would not offend you 
To punish me for what you make me do 
Seems much unequal  hes married to Octavia 

O  that his fault should make a knave of thee 
That art not what thourt sure of  Get thee hence 
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome 
Are all too dear for me  lie they upon thy hand 
And be undone by em 


Good your highness  patience 

In praising Antony I have dispraisd C sar 

Many times  madam 

I am paid for t now 
Lead me from hence 
I faint  O Iras  Charmian  Tis no matter 
Go to the fellow  good Alexas  bid him 
Report the feature of Octavia  her years 
Her inclination  let him not leave out 
The colour of her hair  bring me word quickly 

Let him forever go let him not Charmian 
Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon 
The other ways a Mars 

Bid you Alexas 
Bring me word how tall she is  Pity me  Charmian 
But do not speak to me  Lead me to my chamber 


Your hostages I have  so have you mine 
And we shall talk before we fight 

Most meet 
That first we come to words  and therefore have we 
Our written purposes before us sent 
Which if thou hast considerd  let us know 
If twill tie up thy discontented sword 
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth 
That else must perish here 

To you all three 
The senators alone of this great world 
Chief factors for the gods  I do not know 
Wherefore my father should revengers want 
Having a son and friends  since Julius C sar 
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted 
There saw you labouring for him  What was t 
That movd pale Cassius to conspire  and what 
Made the allhonourd  honest Roman  Brutus 
With the armd rest  courtiers of beauteous freedom 
To drench the Capitol  but that they would 
Have one man but a man  And that is it 
Hath made me rig my navy  at whose burden 
The angerd ocean foams  with which I meant 
To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome 
Cast on my noble father 

Take your time 

Thou canst not fear us  Pompey  with thy sails 
We ll speak with thee at sea  at land  thou knowst 
How much we do oercount thee 

At land  indeed 
Thou dost oercount me of my fathers house 
But  since the cuckoo builds not for himself 
Remain in t as thou mayst 

Be pleasd to tell us 
For this is from the present how you take 
The offers we have sent you 

Theres the point 

Which do not be entreated to  but weigh 
What it is worth embracd 

And what may follow 
To try a larger fortune 

You have made me offer 
Of Sicily  Sardinia  and I must 
Rid all the sea of pirates  then  to send 
Measures of wheat to Rome  this greed upon 
To part with unhackd edges  and bear back 
Our targets undinted 

Thats our offer 

Thats our offer 

Thats our offer 

Know  then 
I came before you here a man prepard 
To take this offer  but Mark Antony 
Put me to some impatience  Though I lose 
The praise of it by telling  you must know 
When C sar and your brother were at blows 
Your mother came to Sicily and did find 
Her welcome friendly 

I have heard it  Pompey 
And am well studied for a liberal thanks 
Which I do owe you 

Let me have your hand 
I did not think  sir  to have met you here 

The beds i the east are soft  and thanks to you 
That calld me timelier than my purpose hither 
For I have gaind by t 

Since I saw you last 
There is a change upon you 

Well  I know not 
What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face 
But in my bosom shall she never come 
To make my heart her vassal 

Well met here 

I hope so  Lepidus  Thus we are agreed 
I crave our composition may be written 
And seald between us 

That s the next to do 

Well feast each other ere we part  and lets 
Draw lots who shall begin 

That will I  Pompey 

No  Antony  take the lot 
But  first or last  your fine Egyptian cookery 
Shall have the fame  I have heard that Julius C sar 
Grew fat with feasting there 

You have heard much 

I have fair meanings  sir 

And fair words to them 

Then  so much have I heard 
And I have heard Apollodorus carried 

No more of that  he did so 

What  I pray you 

A certain queen to C sar in a mattress 

I know thee now  how farst thou  soldier 

Well 
And well am like to do  for I perceive 
Four feasts are toward 

Let me shake thy hand 
I never hated thee  I have seen thee fight 
When I have envied thy behaviour 

Sir 
I never lovd you much  but I ha praisd ye 
When you have well deservd ten times as much 
As I have said you did 

Enjoy thy plainness 
It nothing ill becomes thee 
Aboard my galley I invite you all 
Will you lead  lords 

Show us the way  sir 

Show us the way  sir 

Show us the way  sir 

Come 


Thy father  Pompey  would neer have made this treaty  You and I have known  sir 

At sea  I think 

We have  sir 

You have done well by water 

And you by land 

I will praise any man that will praise me  though it cannot be denied what I have done by land 

Nor what I have done by water 

Yes  something you can deny for your own safety  you have been a great thief by sea 

And you by land 

There I deny my land service  But give me your hand  Menas  if our eyes had authority  here they might take two thieves kissing 

All mens faces are true  whatsoeer their hands are 

But there is never a fair woman has a true face 

No slander  they steal hearts 

We came hither to fight with you 

For my part  I am sorry it is turned to a drinking  Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune 

If he do  sure  he cannot weep it back again 

You have said  sir  We looked not for Mark Antony here  pray you  is he married to Cleopatra 

C sars sister is called Octavia 

True  sir  she was the wife of Caius Marcellus 

But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius 

Pray ye  sir 

Tis true 

Then is C sar and he for ever knit together 

If I were bound to divine of this unity  I would not prophesy so 

I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties 

I think so too  but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity  Octavia is of a holy  cold  and still conversation 

Who would not have his wife so 

Not he that himself is not so  which is Mark Antony  He will to his Egyptian dish again  then  shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in C sar  and  as I said before  that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance  Antony will use his affection where it is  he married but his occasion here 

And thus it may be  Come  sir  will you aboard  I have a health for you 

I shall take it  sir  we have used our throats in Egypt 

Come  let s away 


Here theyll be  man  Some o their plants are illrooted already  the least wind i the world will blow them down 

Lepidus is highcoloured 

They have made him drink almsdrink 

As they pinch one another by the disposition  he cries out  No more  reconciles them to his entreaty  and himself to the drink 

But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion 

Why  this it is to have a name in great mens fellowship  I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave 

To be called into a huge sphere  and not to be seen to move int  are the holes where eyes should be  which pitifully disaster the cheeks 

Thus do they  sir  They take the flow o the Nile 
By certain scales i the pyramid  they know 
By the height  the lowness  or the mean  if dearth 
Or foison follow  The higher Nilus swells 
The more it promises  as it ebbs  the seedsman 
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain 
And shortly comes to harvest 

Youve strange serpents there 

Ay  Lepidus 

Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun  so is your crocodile 

They are so 

Sit and some wine  A health to Lepidus 

I am not so well as I should be  but Ill neer out 

Not till you have slept  I fear me youll be in till then 

Nay  certainly  I have heard the Ptolemies pyramises are very goodly things  without contradiction  I have heard that 

Pompey  a word 

Say in mine ear  what ist 

Forsake thy seat  I do beseech thee  captain 
And bear me speak a word 

Forbear me till anon 
This wine for Lepidus 

What manner o thing is your crocodile 

It is shaped  sir  like itself  and it is as broad as it hath breadth  it is just so high as it is  and moves with it own organs  it lives by that which nourisheth it  and the elements once out of it  it transmigrates 

What colour is it of 

Of it own colour too 

Tis a strange serpent 

Tis so  and the tears of it are wet 

Will this description satisfy him 

With the health that Pompey gives him  else he is a very epicure 

Go hang  sir  hang  Tell me of that  away 
Do as I bid you  Wheres this cup I calld for 

If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me 
Rise from thy stool 

I think thourt mad  The matter 


I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes 

Thou hast servd me with much faith  What s else to say 
Be jolly  lords 

These quicksands  Lepidus 
Keep off them  for you sink 

Wilt thou be lord of all the world 

What sayst thou 

Wilt thou be lord of the whole world  That s twice 

How should that be 

But entertain it 
And though thou think me poor  I am the man 
Will give thee all the world 

Hast thou drunk well 

No  Pompey  I have kept me from the cup 
Thou art  if thou darst be  the earthly Jove 
Whateer the ocean pales  or sky inclips 
Is thine  if thou wilt ha t 

Show me which way 

These three worldsharers  these competitors 
Are in thy vessel  let me cut the cable 
And  when we are put off  fall to their throats 
All there is thine 

Ah  this thou shouldst have done 
And not have spoke on t  In me tis villany 
In thee t had been good service  Thou must know 
Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour 
Mine honour it  Repent that eer thy tongue 
Hath so betrayd thine act  being done unknown 
I should have found it afterwards well done 
But must condemn it now  Desist  and drink 

For this 
Ill never follow thy palld fortunes more 
Who seeks  and will not take when once tis offerd 
Shall never find it more 

This health to Lepidus 

Bear him ashore  Ill pledge it for him  Pompey 

Heres to thee  Menas 

Enobarbus  welcome 

Fill till the cup be hid 

Theres a strong fellow  Menas 


Why 

A bears the third part of the world  man  seest not 

The third part then is drunk  would it were all 
That it might go on wheels 

Drink thou  increase the reels 

Come 

This is not yet an Alexandrian feast 

It ripens towards it  Strike the vessels  ho 
Here is to C sar 

I could well forbeart 
Its monstrous labour  when I wash my brain 
And it grows fouler 

Be a child o the time 

Possess it  Ill make answer 
But I had rather fast from all four days 
Than drink so much in one 

Ha  my brave emperor 
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals 
And celebrate our drink 

Let s ha t  good soldier 

Come  let s all take hands 
Till that the conquering wine hath steepd our sense 
In soft and delicate Lethe 

All take hands 
Make battery to our ears with the loud music 
The while Ill place you  then the boy shall sing 
The holding every man shall bear as loud 
As his strong sides can volley 


Come  thou monarch of the vine 
Plumpy Bacchus  with pink eyne 
In thy fats our cares be drownd 
With thy grapes our hairs be crownd 
Cup us  till the world go round 
Cup us  till the world go round 

What would you more  Pompey  good night  Good brother 
Let me request you off  our graver business 
Frowns at this levity  Gentle lords  lets part 
You see we have burnt our cheeks  strong Enobarb 
Is weaker than the wine  and mine own tongue 
Splits what it speaks  the wild disguise hath almost 
Antickd us all  What needs more words  Good night 
Good Antony  your hand 

Ill try you on the shore 

And shall  sir  Gives your hand 

O  Antony 
You have my father s house But  what  we are friends 
Come down into the boat 

Take heed you fall not 

Menas  Ill not on shore 

No  to my cabin 
These drums  these trumpets  flutes  what 
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell 
To these great fellows  sound and be hangd  sound out 


Hoo  says a  Theres my cap 

Hoo  noble captain  come 


Now  darting Parthia  art thou struck  and now 
Pleasd fortune does of Marcus Crassus death 
Make me revenger  Bear the kings sons body 
Before our army  Thy Pacorus  Orodes 
Pays this for Marcus Crassus 

Noble Ventidius 
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm 
The fugitive Parthians follow  spur through Media 
Mesopotamia  and the shelters whither 
The routed fly  so thy grand captain Antony 
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and 
Put garlands on thy head 

O Silius  Silius 
I have done enough  a lower place  note well 
May make too great an act  for learn this  Silius 
Better to leave undone than by our deed 
Acquire too high a fame when him we serves away 
C sar and Antony have ever won 
More in their officer than person  Sossius 
One of my place in Syria  his lieutenant 
For quick accumulation of renown 
Which he achievd by the minute  lost his favour 
Who does i the wars more than his captain can 
Becomes his captains captain  and ambition 
The soldiers virtue  rather makes choice of loss 
Than gain which darkens him 
I could do more to do Antonius good 
But twould offend him  and in his offence 
Should my performance perish 

Thou hast  Ventidius  that 
Without the which a soldier  and his sword 
Grants scarce distinction  Thou wilt write to Antony 

Ill humbly signify what in his name 
That magical word of war  we have effected 
How  with his banners and his wellpaid ranks 
The neeryetbeaten horse of Parthia 
We have jaded out o the field 

Where is he now 

He purposeth to Athens  whither  with what haste 
The weight we must convey with s will permit 
We shall appear before him  On  there  pass along 


What  are the brothers parted 

They have dispatchd with Pompey  he is gone 
The other three are sealing  Octavia weeps 
To part from Rome  C sar is sad  and Lepidus 
Since Pompeys feast  as Menas says  is troubled 
With the green sickness 

Tis a noble Lepidus 

A very fine one  O  how he loves C sar 

Nay  but how dearly he adores Mark Antony 

C sar  Why  hes the Jupiter of men 

Whats Antony  The god of Jupiter 

Spake you of C sar  How  the nonpareil 

O  Antony  O thou Arabian bird 

Would you praise C sar  say  C sar  go no further 

Indeed  he plied them both with excellent praises 

But he loves C sar best  yet he loves Antony 
Hoo  hearts  tongues  figures  scribes  bards  poets  cannot 
Think  speak  cast  write  sing  number  hoo 
His love to Antony  But as for C sar 
Kneel down  kneel down  and wonder 

Both he loves 

They are his shards  and he their beetle 


So 
This is to horse  Adieu  noble Agrippa 

Good fortune  worthy soldier  and farewell 


No further  sir 

You take from me a great part of myself 
Use me well int  Sister  prove such a wife 
As my thoughts make thee  and as my furthest band 
Shall pass on thy approof  Most noble Antony 
Let not the piece of virtue  which is set 
Betwixt us as the cement of our love 
To keep it builded  be the ram to batter 
The fortress of it  for better might we 
Have lovd without this mean  if on both parts 
This be not cherishd 

Make me not offended 
In your distrust 

I have said 

You shall not find 
Though you be therein curious  the least cause 
For what you seem to fear  So  the gods keep you 
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends 
We will here part 

Farewell  my dearest sister  fare thee well 
The elements be kind to thee  and make 
Thy spirits all of comfort  fare thee well 

My noble brother 

The Aprils in her eyes  it is loves spring 
And these the showers to bring it on  Be cheerful 

Sir  look well to my husbands house  and 

What 
Octavia 

Ill tell you in your ear 

Her tongue will not obey her heart  nor can 
Her heart obey her tongue  the swans downfeather 
That stands upon the swell at full of tide 
And neither way inclines 

Will C sar weep 

He has a cloud ins face 

He were the worse for that were he a horse 
So is he  being a man 

Why  Enobarbus 
When Antony found Julius C sar dead 
He cried almost to roaring  and he wept 
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain 

That year  indeed  he was troubled with a rheum 
What willingly he did confound he waild 
Believe t  till I wept too 

No  sweet Octavia 
You shall hear from me still  the time shall not 
Outgo my thinking on you 

Come  sir  come 
Ill wrestle with you in my strength of love 
Look  here I have you  thus I let you go 
And give you to the gods 

Adieu  be happy 

Let all the number of the stars give light 
To thy fair way 

Farewell  farewell 


Farewell 


Where is the fellow 

Half afeard to come 

Go to  go to 

Come hither  sir 

Good majesty 
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you 
But when you are well pleasd 

That Herods head 
Ill have  but how  when Antony is gone 
Through whom I might command it  Come thou near 

Most gracious majesty 

Didst thou behold 
Octavia 

Ay  dread queen 

Where 

Madam  in Rome 
I lookd her in the face  and saw her led 
Between her brother and Mark Antony 

Is she as tall as me 

She is not  madam 

Didst hear her speak  is she shrilltongud  or low 

Madam  I heard her speak  she is lowvoicd 

Thats not so good  He cannot like her long 

Like her  O Isis  tis impossible 

I think so  Charmian  dull of tongue  and dwarfish 
What majesty is in her gait  Remember 
If eer thou lookdst on majesty 

She creeps 
Her motion and her station are as one 
She shows a body rather than a life 
A statue than a breather 

Is this certain 

Or I have no observance 

Three in Egypt 
Cannot make better note 

Hes very knowing 
I do perceive t  Theres nothing in her yet 
The fellow has good judgment 

Excellent 

Guess at her years  I prithee 

Madam 
She was a widow 

Widow  Charmian  hark 

And I do think shes thirty 

Bearst thou her face in mind  ist long or round 

Round even to faultiness 

For the most part  too  they are foolish that are so 
Her hair  what colour 

Brown  madam  and her forehead 
As low as she would wish it 

Theres gold for thee 
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill 
I will employ thee back again  I find thee 
Most fit for business  Go  make thee ready 
Our letters are prepard 


A proper man 

Indeed  he is so  I repent me much 
That so I harried him  Why  methinks  by him 
This creatures no such thing 

Nothing  madam 

The man hath seen some majesty  and should know 

Hath he seen majesty  Isis else defend 
And serving you so long 

I have one thing more to ask him yet  good Charmian 
But tis no matter  thou shalt bring him to me 
Where I will write  All may be well enough 

I warrant you  madam 


Nay  nay  Octavia  not only that 
That were excusable  that  and thousands more 
Of semblable import  but he hath wagd 
New wars gainst Pompey  made his will  and read it 
To public ear 
Spoke scantly of me  when perforce he could not 
But pay me terms of honour  cold and sickly 
He vented them  most narrow measure lent me 
When the best hint was given him  he not took t 
Or did it from his teeth 

O my good lord 
Believe not all  or  if you must believe 
Stomach not all  A more unhappy lady 
If this division chance  neer stood between 
Praying for both parts 
The good gods will mock me presently 
When I shall pray  O  bless my lord and husband  
Undo that prayer  by crying out as loud 
O  bless my brother  Husband win  win brother 
Prays  and destroys the prayer  no midway 
Twixt these extremes at all 

Gentle Octavia 
Let your best love draw to that point which seeks 
Best to preserve it  If I lose mine honour 
I lose myself  better I were not yours 
Than yours so branchless  But  as you requested 
Yourself shall go betweens  the mean time  lady 
Ill raise the preparation of a war 
Shall stain your brother  make your soonest haste 
So your desires are yours 

Thanks to my lord 
The Jove of power make me most weak  most weak 
Your reconciler  Wars twixt you twain would be 
As if the world should cleave  and that slain men 
Should solder up the rift 

When it appears to you where this begins 
Turn your displeasure that way  for our faults 
Can never be so equal that your love 
Can equally move with them  Provide your going 
Choose your own company  and command what cost 
Your heart has mind to 


How now  friend Eros 

Theres strange news come  sir 

What  man 

C sar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey 

This is old  what is the success 

C sar  having made use of him in the wars gainst Pompey  presently denied him rivality  would not let him partake in the glory of the action  and not resting here  accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey  upon his own appeal  seizes him  so the poor third is up  till death enlarge his confine 

Then  world  thou hast a pair of chaps  no more 
And throw between them all the food thou hast 
Theyll grind the one the other  Wheres Antony 

Hes walking in the garden thus  and spurns 
The rush that lies before him  cries  Fool  Lepidus  
And threats the throat of that his officer 
That murderd Pompey 

Our great navys riggd 

For Italy and C sar  More  Domitius 
My lord desires you presently  my news 
I might have told hereafter 

Twill be naught 
But let it be  Bring me to Antony 

Come  sir 


Contemning Rome  he has done all this and more 
In Alexandria  heres the manner of t 
I the marketplace  on a tribunal silverd 
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold 
Were publicly enthrond  at the feet sat 
C sarion  whom they call my fathers son 
And all the unlawful issue that their lust 
Since then hath made between them  Unto her 
He gave the stablishment of Egypt  made her 
Of Lower Syria  Cyprus  Lydia 
Absolute queen 

This in the public eye 

I the common showplace  where they exercise 
His sons he there proclaimd the kings of kings 
Great Media  Parthia  and Armenia 
He gave to Alexander  to Ptolemy he assignd 
Syria  Cilicia  and Ph nicia  She 
In the habiliments of the goddess Isis 
That day appeard  and oft before gave audience 
As tis reported  so 

Let Rome be thus 
Informed 

Who  queasy with his insolence 
Already  will their good thoughts call from him 

The people know it  and have now receivd 
His accusations 

Whom does he accuse 

C sar  and that  having in Sicily 
Sextus Pompeius spoild  we had not rated him 
His part o the isle  then does he say  he lent me 
Some shipping unrestord  lastly  he frets 
That Lepidus of the triumvirate 
Should be deposd  and  being  that we detain 
All his revenue 

Sir  this should be answerd 

Tis done already  and the messenger gone 
I have told him  Lepidus was grown too cruel 
That he his high authority abusd 
And did deserve his change  for what I have conquerd 
I grant him part  but then  in his Armenia 
And other of his conquerd kingdoms  I 
Demand the like 

Hell never yield to that 

Nor must not then be yielded to in this 


Hail  C sar  and my lord  hail  most dear C sar 

That ever I should call thee castaway 

You have not calld me so  nor have you cause 

Why have you stoln upon us thus  You come not 
Like C sars sister  the wife of Antony 
Should have an army for an usher  and 
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach 
Long ere she did appear  the trees by the way 
Should have borne men  and expectation fainted 
Longing for what it had not  nay  the dust 
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven 
Raisd by your populous troops  But you are come 
A marketmaid to Rome  and have prevented 
The ostentation of our love  which  left unshown 
Is often left unlovd  we should have met you 
By sea and land  supplying every stage 
With an augmented greeting 

Good my lord 
To come thus was I not constraind  but did it 
On my freewill  My lord  Mark Antony 
Hearing that you prepard for war  acquainted 
My grieved ear withal  whereon  I beggd 
His pardon for return 

Which soon he granted 
Being an obstruct tween his lust and him 

Do not say so  my lord 

I have eyes upon him 
And his affairs come to me on the wind 
Where is he now 

My lord  in Athens 

No  my most wrongd sister  Cleopatra 
Hath nodded him to her  He hath given his empire 
Up to a whore  who now are levying 
The kings o the earth for war  He hath assembled 
Bocchus  the King of Libya  Archelaus 
Of Cappadocia  Philadelphos  King 
Of Paphlagonia  the Thracian king  Adallas 
King Malchus of Arabia  King of Pont 
Herod of Jewry  Mithridates  King 
Of Comagene  Polemon and Amintas 
The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia 
With a more larger list of sceptres 

Ay me  most wretched 
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends 
That do afflict each other 

Welcome hither 
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth 
Till we perceivd both how you were wrong led 
And we in negligent danger  Cheer your heart 
Be you not troubled with the time  which drives 
Oer your content these strong necessities 
But let determind things to destiny 
Hold unbewaild their way  Welcome to Rome 
Nothing more dear to me  You are abusd 
Beyond the mark of thought  and the high gods 
To do you justice  make their ministers 
Of us and those that love you  Best of comfort 
And ever welcome to us 

Welcome  lady 

Welcome  dear madam 
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you 
Only the adulterous Antony  most large 
In his abominations  turns you off 
And gives his potent regiment to a trull 
That noises it against us 

Is it so  sir 

Most certain  Sister  welcome  pray you 
Be ever known to patience  my dearest sister 


I will be even with thee  doubt it not 

But why  why  why 

Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars 
And sayst it is not fit 

Well  is it  is it 

If not denouncd against us  why should not we 
Be there in person 

Well  I could reply 
If we should serve with horse and mares together 
The horse were merely lost  the mares would bear 
A soldier and his horse 

What is t you say 

Your presence needs must puzzle Antony 
Take from his heart  take from his brain  from s time 
What should not then be spard  He is already 
Traducd for levity  and tis said in Rome 
That Photinus a eunuch and your maids 
Manage this war 

Sink Rome  and their tongues rot 
That speak against us  A charge we bear i the war 
And  as the president of my kingdom  will 
Appear there for a man  Speak not against it 
I will not stay behind 

Nay  I have done 
Here comes the emperor 


Is it not strange  Canidius 
That from Tarentum and Brundusium 
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea 
And take in Toryne  You have heard on t  sweet 

Celerity is never more admird 
Than by the negligent 

A good rebuke 
Which might have well becomd the best of men 
To taunt at slackness  Canidius  we 
Will fight with him by sea 

By sea  What else 

Why will my lord do so 

For that he dares us to t 

So hath my lord dard him to single fight 

Ay  and to wage his battle at Pharsalia 
Where C sar fought with Pompey  but these offers 
Which serve not for his vantage  he shakes off 
And so should you 

Your ships are not well mannd 
Your mariners are muleters  reapers  people 
Ingrossd by swift impress  in C sars fleet 
Are those that often have gainst Pompey fought 
Their ships are yare  yours  heavy  No disgrace 
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea 
Being prepard for land 

By sea  by sea 

Most worthy sir  you therein throw away 
The absolute soldiership you have by land 
Distract your army  which doth most consist 
Of warmarkd footmen  leave unexecuted 
Your own renowned knowledge  quite forego 
The way which promises assurance  and 
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard 
From firm security 

Ill fight at sea 

I have sixty sails  C sar none better 

Our overplus of shipping will we burn 
And with the rest  fullmannd  from the head of Actium 
Beat the approaching C sar  But if we fail 
We then can do t at land 

Thy business 

The news is true  my lord  he is descried 
C sar has taken Toryne 

Can he be there in person  tis impossible 
Strange that his power should be  Canidius 
Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land 
And our twelve thousand horse  Well to our ship 
Away  my Thetis 

How now  worthy soldier 

O noble emperor  do not fight by sea 
Trust not to rotten planks  do you misdoubt 
This sword and these my wounds  Let the Egyptians 
And the Ph nicians go aducking  we 
Have used to conquer  standing on the earth 
And fighting foot to foot 

Well  well  away 


By Hercules  I think I am i the right 

Soldier  thou art  but his whole action grows 
Not in the power on t  so our leaders led 
And we are womens men 

You keep by land 
The legions and the horse whole  do you not 

Marcus Octavius  Marcus Justeius 
Publicola  and C lius  are for sea 
But we keep whole by land  This speed of C sars 
Carries beyond belief 

While he was yet in Rome 
His power went out in such distractions as 
Beguild all spies 

Whos his lieutenant  hear you 

They say  one Taurus 

Well I know the man 


The emperor calls Canidius 

With news the times with labour  and throes forth 
Each minute some 


Taurus 

My lord 

Strike not by land  keep whole  provoke not battle 
Till we have done at sea  Do not exceed 
The prescript of this scroll  our fortune lies 
Upon this jump 

Set we our squadrons on yond side o the hill 
In eye of C sars battle  from which place 
We may the number of the ships behold 
And so proceed accordingly 


Naught  naught  all naught  I can behold no longer 
The Antoniad  the Egyptian admiral 
With all their sixty  fly  and turn the rudder 
To see t mine eyes are blasted 


Gods and goddesses 
All the whole synod of them 

Whats thy passion 

The greater cantle of the world is lost 
With very ignorance  we have kissd away 
Kingdoms and provinces 

How appears the fight 

On our side like the tokend pestilence 
Where death is sure  Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt 
Whom leprosy oertake  i the midst o the fight 
When vantage like a pair of twins appeard 
Both as the same  or rather ours the elder 
The breese upon her  like a cow in June 
Hoists sails and flies 

That I beheld 
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight  and could not 
Endure a further view 

She once being loofd 
The noble ruin of her magic  Antony 
Clapson his seawing  and like a doting mallard 
Leaving the fight in height  flies after her 
I never saw an action of such shame 
Experience  manhood  honour  neer before 
Did violate so itself 

Alack  alack 


Our fortune on the sea is out of breath 
And sinks most lamentably  Had our general 
Been what he knew himself  it had gone well 
O  he has given example for our flight 
Most grossly by his own 

Ay  are you thereabouts 
Why  then  good night  indeed 

Towards Peloponnesus are they fled 

Tis easy to t  and there I will attend 
What further comes 

To C sar will I render 
My legions and my horse  six kings already 
Show me the way of yielding 

Ill yet follow 
The wounded chance of Antony  though my reason 
Sits in the wind against me 


Hark  the land bids me tread no more upon t 
It is ashamd to bear me  Friends  come hither 
I am so lated in the world that I 
Have lost my way for ever  I have a ship 
Laden with gold  take that  divide it  fly 
And make your peace with C sar 

Fly  not we 

I have fled myself  and have instructed cowards 
To run and show their shoulders  Friends  be gone 
I have myself resolvd upon a course 
Which has no need of you  be gone 
My treasures in the harbour  take it  O 
I followd that I blush to look upon 
My very hairs do mutiny  for the white 
Reprove the brown for rashness  and they them 
For fear and doting  Friends  be gone  you shall 
Have letters from me to some friends that will 
Sweep your way for you  Pray you  look not sad 
Nor make replies of loathness  take the hint 
Which my despair proclaims  let that be left 
Which leaves itself  to the seaside straightway 
I will possess you of that ship and treasure 
Leave me  I pray  a little  pray you now 
Nay  do so  for  indeed  I have lost command 
Therefore I pray you  Ill see you by and by 

Nay  gentle madam  to him  comfort him 

Do  most dear queen 

Do  Why  what else 

Let me sit down  O Juno 

No  no  no  no  no 

See you here  sir 

O fie  fie  fie 

Madam 

Madam  O good empress 

Sir  sir 

Yes  my lord  yes  He  at Philippi kept 
His sword een like a dancer  while I struck 
The lean and wrinkled Cassius  and twas I 
That the mad Brutus ended  he alone 
Dealt on lieutenantry  and no practice had 
In the brave squares of war  yet now No matter 

Ah  stand by 

The queen  my lord  the queen 

Go to him  madam  speak to him 
He is unqualitied with very shame 

Well then  sustain me  O 

Most noble sir  arise  the queen approaches 
Her heads declind  and death will seize her  but 
Your comfort makes the rescue 

I have offended reputation 
A most unnoble swerving 

Sir  the queen 

O  whither hast thou led me  Egypt  See 
How I convey my shame out of thine eyes 
By looking back what I have left behind 
Stroyd in dishonour 

O my lord  my lord 
Forgive my fearful sails  I little thought 
You would have followd 

Egypt  thou knewst too well 
My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings 
And thou shouldst tow me after  oer my spirit 
Thy full supremacy thou knewst  and that 
Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods 
Command me 

O  my pardon 

Now I must 
To the young man send humble treaties  dodge 
And palter in the shifts of lowness  who 
With half the bulk o the world playd as I pleasd 
Making and marring fortunes  You did know 
How much you were my conqueror  and that 
My sword  made weak by my affection  would 
Obey it on all cause 

Pardon  pardon 

Fall not a tear  I say  one of them rates 
All that is won and lost  Give me a kiss 
Even this repays me  We sent our schoolmaster 
Is he come back  Love  I am full of lead 
Some wine  within there  and our viands  Fortune knows 
We scorn her most when most she offers blows 

Let him appear thats come from Antony 
Know you him 

C sar  tis his schoolmaster 
An argument that he is pluckd  when hither 
He sends so poor a pinion of his wing 
Which had superfluous kings for messengers 
Not many moons gone by 


Approach  and speak 

Such as I am  I come from Antony 
I was of late as petty to his ends 
As is the morndew on the myrtleleaf 
To his grand sea 

Be t so  Declare thine office 

Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee  and 
Requires to live in Egypt  which not granted 
He lessens his requests  and to thee sues 
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth 
A private man in Athens  this for him 
Next  Cleopatra does confess thy greatness 
Submits her to thy might  and of thee craves 
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs 
Now hazarded to thy grace 

For Antony 
I have no ears to his request  The queen 
Of audience nor desire shall fail  so she 
From Egypt drive her alldisgraced friend 
Or take his life there  this if she perform 
She shall not sue unheard  So to them both 

Fortune pursue thee 

Bring him through the bands 

From Antony win Cleopatra  promise 
And in our name  what she requires  add more 
From thine invention  offers  Women are not 
In their best fortunes strong  but want will perjure 
The neertouchd vestal  Try thy cunning  Thyreus 
Make thine own edict for thy pains  which we 

Will answer as a law 

C sar  I go 

Observe how Antony becomes his flaw 
And what thou thinkst his very action speaks 
In every power that moves 

C sar  I shall 

What shall we do  Enobarbus 

Think  and die 

Is Antony or we  in fault for this 

Antony only  that would make his will 
Lord of his reason  What though you fled 
From that great face of war  whose several ranges 
Frighted each other  why should he follow 
The itch of his affection should not then 
Have nickd his captainship  at such a point 
When half to half the world opposd  he being 
The mered question  Twas a shame no less 
Than was his loss  to course your flying flags 
And leave his navy gazing 

Prithee  peace 


Is that his answer 

Ay  my lord 

The queen shall then have courtesy  so she 
Will yield us up 

He says so 

Let her knowt 
To the boy C sar send this grizzled head 
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim 
With principalities 

That head  my lord 

To him again  Tell him he wears the rose 
Of youth upon him  from which the world should note 
Something particular  his coin  ships  legions 
May be a cowards  whose ministers would prevail 
Under the service of a child as soon 
As i the command of C sar  I dare him therefore 
To lay his gay comparisons apart 
And answer me declind  sword against sword 
Ourselves alone  Ill write it  follow me 


Yes  like enough  highbattled C sar will 
Unstate his happiness  and be stagd to the show 
Against a sworder  I see mens judgments are 
A parcel of their fortunes  and things outward 
Do draw the inward quality after them 
To suffer all alike  That he should dream 
Knowing all measures  the full C sar will 
Answer his emptiness  C sar  thou hast subdud 
His judgment too 


A messenger from C sar 

What  no more ceremony  See  my women 
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose 
That kneeld unto the buds  Admit him  sir 


Mine honesty and I begin to square 
The loyalty well held to fools does make 
Our faith mere folly  yet he that can endure 
To follow with allegiance a falln lord 
Does conquer him that did his master conquer 
And earns a place i the story 


C sars will 

Hear it apart 

None but friends  say boldly 

So  haply  are they friends to Antony 

He needs as many  sir  as C sar has 
Or needs not us  If C sar please  our master 
Will leap to be his friend  for us  you know 
Whose he is we are  and that is C sars 

So 
Thus then  thou most renownd  C sar entreats 
Not to consider in what case thou standst 
Further than he is C sar 

Go on  right royal 

He knows that you embrace not Antony 
As you did love  but as you feard him 

O 

The scars upon your honour therefore he 
Does pity  as constrained blemishes 
Not as deservd 

He is a god  and knows 
What is most right  Mine honour was not yielded 
But conquerd merely 

To be sure of that 
I will ask Antony  Sir  sir  thourt so leaky 
That we must leave thee to thy sinking  for 
Thy dearest quit thee 


Shall I say to C sar 
What you require of him  for he partly begs 
To be desird to give  It much would please him 
That of his fortunes you should make a staff 
To lean upon  but it would warm his spirits 
To hear from me you had left Antony 
And put yourself under his shroud 
The universal landlord 

Whats your name 

My name is Thyreus 

Most kind messenger 
Say to great C sar this  in deputation 
I kiss his conquring hand  tell him  I am prompt 
To lay my crown at s feet  and there to kneel 
Tell him  from his allobeying breath I hear 
The doom of Egypt 

Tis your noblest course 
Wisdom and fortune combating together 
If that the former dare but what it can 
No chance may shake it  Give me grace to lay 
My duty on your hand 

Your C sars father oft 
When he hath musd of taking kingdoms in 
Bestowd his lips on that unworthy place 
As it raind kisses 


Favours  by Jove that thunders 
What art thou  fellow 

One that but performs 
The bidding of the fullest man  and worthiest 
To have command obeyd 

You will be whippd 

Approach there  Ah  you kite  Now  gods and devils 
Authority melts from me  of late  when I cried Ho  
Like boys unto a muss  kings would start forth 
And cry  Your will  Have you no ears  I am 
Antony yet 

Take hence this Jack and whip him 

Tis better playing with a lions whelp 
Than with an old one dying 

Moon and stars 
Whip him  Weret twenty of the greatest tributaries 
That do acknowledge C sar  should I find them 
So saucy with the hand of she here  whats her name 
Since she was Cleopatra  Whip him  fellows 
Till  like a boy  you see him cringe his face 
And whine aloud for mercy  take him hence 

Mark Antony 

Tug him away  being whippd 
Bring him again  this Jack of C sars shall 
Bear us an errand to him 

You were half blasted ere I knew you  ha 
Have I my pillow left unpressd in Rome 
Forborne the getting of a lawful race 
And by a gem of women  to be abusd 
By one that looks on feeders 

Good my lord 

You have been a boggler ever 
But when we in our viciousness grow hard 
O misery on t the wise gods seel our eyes 
In our own filth drop our clear judgments  make us 
Adore our errors  laugh at s while we strut 
To our confusion 

O  ist come to this 

I found you as a morsel  cold upon 
Dead C sars trencher  nay  you were a fragment 
Of Cneius Pompeys  besides what hotter hours 
Unregisterd in vulgar fame  you have 
Luxuriously pickd out  for  I am sure 
Though you can guess what temperance should be 
You know not what it is 

Wherefore is this 

To let a fellow that will take rewards 
And say God quit you  be familiar with 
My playfellow  your hand  this kingly seal 
And plighter of high hearts  O  that I were 
Upon the hill of Basan  to outroar 
The horned herd  for I have savage cause 
And to proclaim it civilly were like 
A halterd neck  which does the hangman thank 
For being yare about him 

Is he whippd 

Soundly  my lord 

Cried he  and beggd a pardon 

He did ask favour 

If that thy father live  let him repent 
Thou wast not made his daughter  and be thou sorry 
To follow C sar in his triumph  since 
Thou hast been whippd for following him  henceforth 
The white hand of a lady fever thee 
Shake thou to look on t  Get thee back to C sar 
Tell him thy entertainment  look  thou say 
He makes me angry with him  for he seems 
Proud and disdainful  harping on what I am 
Not what he knew I was  he makes me angry 
And at this time most easy tis to do t 
When my good stars  that were my former guides 
Have empty left their orbs  and shot their fires 
Into the abysm of hell  If he mislike 
My speech and what is done  tell him he has 
Hipparchus  my enfranched bondman  whom 
He may at pleasure whip  or hang  or torture 
As he shall like  to quit me  urge it thou 
Hence with thy stripes  be gone 


Have you done yet 

Alack  our terrene moon 
Is now eclipsd  and it portends alone 
The fall of Antony 

I must stay his time 

To flatter C sar  would you mingle eyes 
With one that ties his points 

Not know me yet 

Coldhearted toward me 

Ah  dear  if I be so 
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail 
And poison it in the source  and the first stone 
Drop in my neck  as it determines  so 
Dissolve my life  The next C sarion smite 
Till by degrees the memory of my womb 
Together with my brave Egyptians all 
By the discandying of this pelleted storm 
Lie graveless  till the flies and gnats of Nile 
Have buried them for prey 

I am satisfied 
C sar sits down in Alexandria  where 
I will oppose his fate  Our force by land 
Hath nobly held  our severd navy too 
Have knit again  and fleet  threatning most sealike 
Where hast thou been  my heart  Dost thou hear  lady 
If from the field I shall return once more 
To kiss these lips  I will appear in blood 
I and my sword will earn our chronicle 
Theres hope in t yet 

Thats my brave lord 

I will betreblesinewd  hearted  breathd 
And fight maliciously  for when mine hours 
Were nice and lucky  men did ransom lives 
Of me for jests  but now Ill set my teeth 
And send to darkness all that stop me  Come 
Lets have one other gaudy night  call to me 
All my sad captains  fill our bowls once more 
Lets mock the midnight bell 

It is my birthday 
I had thought to have held it poor  but  since my lord 
Is Antony again  I will be Cleopatra 

We will yet do well 

Call all his noble captains to my lord 

Do so  well speak to them  and tonight Ill force 
The wine peep through their scars  Come on  my queen 
Theres sap in t yet  The next time I do fight 
Ill make death love me  for I will contend 
Even with his pestilent scythe 


Now hell outstare the lightning  To be furious 
Is to be frighted out of fear  and in that mood 
The dove will peck the estridge  and I see still 
A diminution in our captains brain 
Restores his heart  When valour preys on reason 
It eats the sword it fights with  I will seek 
Some way to leave him 

He calls me boy  and chides as he had power 
To beat me out of Egypt  my messenger 
He hath whippd with rods  dares me to personal combat 
C sar to Antony  Let the old ruffian know 
I have many other ways to die  meantime 
Laugh at his challenge 

C sar must think 
When one so great begins to rage  hes hunted 
Even to falling  Give him no breath  but now 
Make boot of his distraction  never anger 
Made good guard for itself 

Let our best heads 
Know that tomorrow the last of many battles 
We mean to fight  Within our files there are 
Of those that servd Mark Antony but late 
Enough to fetch him in  See it done 
And feast the army  we have store to do t 
And they have earnd the waste  Poor Antony 


He will not fight with me  Domitius 

No 

Why should he not 

He thinks  being twenty times of better fortune 
He is twenty men to one 

Tomorrow  soldier 
By sea and land Ill fight  or I will live 
Or bathe my dying honour in the blood 
Shall make it live again  Woot thou fight well 

Ill strike  and cry  Take all  

Well said  come on 
Call forth my household servants  lets tonight 
Be bounteous at our meal 


Give me thy hand 
Thou hast been rightly honest  so hast thou 
Thou  and thou  and thou  you have servd me well 

And kings have been your fellows 

What means this 

Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots 
Out of the mind 

And thou art honest too 
I wish I could be made so many men 
And all of you clappd up together in 
An Antony  that I might do you service 
So good as you have done 

The gods forbid 

Well  my good fellows  wait on me tonight 
Scant not my cups  and make as much of me 
As when mine empire was your fellow too 
And sufferd my command 

What does he mean 

To make his followers weep 

Tend me tonight 
May be it is the period of your duty 
Haply  you shall not see me more  or if 
A mangled shadow  perchance tomorrow 
Youll serve another master  I look on you 
As one that takes his leave  Mine honest friends 
I turn you not away  but  like a master 
Married to your good service  stay till death 
Tend me tonight two hours  I ask no more 
And the gods yield you for t 

What mean you  sir 
To give them this discomfort  Look  they weep 
And I  an ass  am onioneyd  for shame 
Transform us not to women 

Ho  ho  ho 
Now  the witch take me  if I meant it thus 
Grace grow where those drops fall  My hearty friends 
You take me in too dolorous a sense 
For I spake to you for your comfort  did desire you 
To burn this night with torches  Know  my hearts 
I hope well of tomorrow  and will lead you 
Where rather Ill expect victorious life 
Than death and honour  Lets to supper  come 
And drown consideration 


Brother  good night  tomorrow is the day 

It will determine one way  fare you well 
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets 

Nothing  What news 

Belike  tis but a rumour  Good night to you 

Well  sir  good night 


Soldiers  have careful watch 

And you  Good night  good night 


Here we 

And if tomorrow 
Our navy thrive  I have an absolute hope 
Our landmen will stand up 

Tis a brave army 
And full of purpose 


Peace  what noise 

List  list 

Hark 

Music i the air 

Under the earth 

It signs well  does it not 

No 

Peace  I say 
What should this mean 

Tis the god Hercules  whom Antony lovd 
Now leaves him 

Walk  lets see if other watchmen 
Do hear what we do 


How now  masters 

How now 
How now do you hear this 

Ay  is t not strange 

Do you hear  masters  do you hear 

Follow the noise so far as we have quarter 
Lets see how t will give off 

Content Tis strange 


Eros  mine armour  Eros 

Sleep a little 

No  my chuck  Eros  come  mine armour  Eros 

Come  good fellow  put mine iron on 
If Fortune be not ours today  it is 
Because we brave her  Come 

Nay  Ill help too 
Whats this for 

Ah  let be  let be  thou art 
The armourer of my heart  false  false  this  this 

Sooth  la  Ill help  thus it must be 

Well  well 
We shall thrive now  Seest thou  my good fellow 
Go put on thy defences 

Briefly  sir 

Is not this buckled well 

Rarely  rarely 
He that unbuckles this  till we do please 
To daff t for our repose  shall hear a storm 
Thou fumblest  Eros  and my queens a squire 
More tight at this than thou  dispatch  O love 
That thou couldst see my wars today  and knewst 
The royal occupation  thou shouldst see 
A workman in t 


Good morrow to thee  welcome 
Thou lookst like him that knows a warlike charge 
To business that we love we rise betime 

And go to t with delight 

A thousand  sir 
Early though t be  have on their riveted trim 
And at the port expect you 

The morn is fair  Good morrow  general 

Good morrow  general 

Tis well blown  lads 
This morning  like the spirit of a youth 
That means to be of note  begins betimes 
So  so  come  give me that  this way  well said 
Fare thee well  dame  whateer becomes of me 
This is a soldiers kiss 

Rebukeable 
And worthy shameful check it were  to stand 
On more mechanic compliment  Ill leave thee 
Now  like a man of steel  You that will fight 
Follow me close  Ill bring you to t  Adieu 


Please you  retire to your chamber 

Lead me 
He goes forth gallantly  That he and C sar might 
Determine this great war in single fight 
Then  Antony but now Well  on 


The gods make this a happy day to Antony 

Would thou and those thy scars had once prevaild 
To make me fight at land 

Hadst thou done so 
The kings that have revolted  and the soldier 
That has this morning left thee  would have still 
Followd thy heels 

Whos gone this morning 

Who 
One ever near thee  call for Enobarbus 
He shall not hear thee  or from C sars camp 
Say  I am none of thine  

What sayst thou 

Sir 
He is with C sar 

Sir  his chests and treasure 
He has not with him 

Is he gone 

Most certain 

Go  Eros  send his treasure after  do it 
Detain no jot  I charge thee  Write to him 
I will subscribe gentle adieus and greetings 
Say that I wish he never find more cause 
To change a master  O  my fortunes have 
Corrupted honest men  Dispatch  Enobarbus 


Go forth  Agrippa  and begin the fight 
Our will is Antony be took alive 
Make it so known 

C sar  I shall 


The time of universal peace is near 
Prove this a prosperous day  the threenookd world 
Shall bear the olive freely 


Antony 
Is come into the field 

Go charge Agrippa 
Plant those that have revolted in the van 
That Antony may seem to spend his fury 
Upon himself 


Alexas did revolt  and went to Jewry on 
Affairs of Antony  there did persuade 
Great Herod to incline himself to C sar 
And leave his master Antony  for this pains 
C sar hath hangd him  Canidius and the rest 
That fell away have entertainment  but 
No honourable trust  I have done ill 
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely 
That I will joy no more 


Enobarbus  Antony 
Hath after thee sent all thy treasure  with 
His bounty overplus  the messenger 
Came on my guard  and at thy tent is now 
Unloading of his mules 

I give it you 

Mock not  Enobarbus 
I tell you true  best you safd the bringer 
Out of the host  I must attend mine office 
Or would have done t myself  Your emperor 
Continues still a Jove 


I am alone the villain of the earth 
And feel I am so most  O Antony 
Thou mine of bounty  how wouldst thou have paid 
My better service  when my turpitude 
Thou dost so crown with gold  This blows my heart 
If swift thought break it not  a swifter mean 
Shall outstrike thought  but thought will do t  I feel 
I fight against thee  No  I will go seek 
Some ditch  wherein to die  the foulst best fits 
My latter part of life 


Retire  we have engagd ourselves too far 
C sar himself has work  and our oppression 
Exceeds what we expected 

O my brave emperor  this is fought indeed 
Had we done so at first  we had droven them home 
With clouts about their heads 

Thou bleedst apace 

I had a wound here that was like a T 
But now tis made an H 

They do retire 

Well beat em into benchholes  I have yet 
Room for six scotches more 


They are beaten  sir  and our advantage serves 
For a fair victory 

Let us score their backs 
And snatch em up  as we take hares  behind 
Tis sport to maul a runner 

I will reward thee 
Once for thy sprightly comfort  and tenfold 
For thy good valour  Come thee on 

Ill halt after 


We have beat him to his camp  run one before 
And let the queen know of our gests  Tomorrow 
Before the sun shall see s  well spill the blood 
That has today escapd  I thank you all 
For doughtyhanded are you  and have fought 
Not as you servd the cause  but as t had been 
Each mans like mine  you have shown all Hectors 
Enter the city  clip your wives  your friends 
Tell them your feats  whilst they with joyful tears 
Wash the congealment from your wounds  and kiss 
The honourd gashes whole 

Give me thy hand 


To this great fairy Ill commend thy acts 
Make her thanks bless thee  O thou day o the world 
Chain mine armd neck  leap thou  attire and all 
Through proof of harness to my heart  and there 

Ride on the pants triumphing 

Lord of lords 
O infinite virtue  comst thou smiling from 
The worlds great snare uncaught 

My nightingale 
We have beat them to their beds  What  girl  though grey 
Do something mingle with our younger brown  yet ha we 
A brain that nourishes our nerves  and can 
Get goal for goal of youth  Behold this man 
Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand 
Kiss it  my warrior  he hath fought today 
As if a god  in hate of mankind  had 
Destroyd in such a shape 

Ill give thee  friend 
An armour all of gold  it was a kings 

He has deservd it  were it carbuncled 
Like holy Ph bus car  Give me thy hand 
Through Alexandria make a jolly march 
Bear our hackd targets like the men that owe them 
Had our great palace the capacity 
To camp this host  we all would sup together 
And drink carouses to the next days fate 
Which promises royal peril  Trumpeters 
With brazen din blast you the citys ear 
Make mingle with our rattling tabourines 
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together 
Applauding our approach 


If we be not relievd within this hour 
We must return to the court of guard  the night 
Is shiny  and they say we shall embattle 
By the second hour i the morn 

This last day was 
A shrewd one to s 


O  bear me witness  night 

What man is this 

Stand close and list him 

Be witness to me  O thou blessed moon 
When men revolted shall upon record 
Bear hateful memory  poor Enobarbus did 
Before thy face repent 

Enobarbus 

Peace 
Hark further 

O sovereign mistress of true melancholy 
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me 
That life  a very rebel to my will 
May hang no longer on me  throw my heart 
Against the flint and hardness of my fault 
Which  being dried with grief  will break to powder 
And finish all foul thoughts  O Antony 
Nobler than my revolt is infamous 
Forgive me in thine own particular 
But let the world rank me in register 
A masterleaver and a fugitive 
O Antony  O Antony 


Lets speak to him 

Lets hear him  for the things he speaks 
May concern C sar 

Lets do so  But he sleeps 

Swounds rather  for so bad a prayer as his 
Was never yet for sleep 

Go we to him 

Awake  sir  awake  speak to us 

Hear you  sir 

The Land of death hath raught him 

Hark  the drums 
Demurely wake the sleepers  Let us bear him 
To the court of guard  he is of note  our hour 
Is fully out 

Come on  then 
He may recover yet 

Their preparation is today by sea 
We please them not by land 

For both  my lord 

I would theyd fight i the fire or i the air 
Wed fight there too  But this it is  our foot 
Upon the hills adjoining to the city 
Shall stay with us  order for sea is given 
They have put forth the haven 
Where their appointment we may best discover 
And look on their endeavour 

But being chargd  we will be still by land 
Which  as I take t  we shall  for his best force 
Is forth to man his galleys  To the vales 
And hold our best advantage 

Yet they are not joind  Where yond pine does stand 
I shall discover all  Ill bring thee word 
Straight how tis like to go 


Swallows have built 
In Cleopatras sails their nests  the augurers 
Say they know not  they cannot tell  look grimly 
And dare not speak their knowledge  Antony 
Is valiant  and dejected  and  by starts 
His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear 
Of what he has and has not 

All is lost 
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me 
My fleet hath yielded to the foe  and yonder 
They cast their caps up and carouse together 
Like friends long lost  Tripleturnd whore  tis thou 
Hast sold me to this novice  and my heart 
Makes only wars on thee  Bid them all fly 
For when I am revengd upon my charm 
I have done all  Bid them all fly  be gone 

O sun  thy uprise shall I see no more 
Fortune and Antony part here  even here 
Do we shake hands  All come to this  The hearts 
That spanield me at heels  to whom I gave 
Their wishes  do discandy  melt their sweets 
On blossoming C sar  and this pine is barkd 
That overtoppd them all  Betrayd I am 
O this false soul of Egypt  this grave charm 
Whose eyes beckd forth my wars  and calld them home 
Whose bosom was my crownet  my chief end 
Like a right gipsy  hath  at fast and loose 
Beguild me to the very heart of loss 
What  Eros  Eros 

Ah  thou spell  Avaunt 

Why is my lord enragd against his love 

Vanish  or I shall give thee thy deserving 
And blemish C sars triumph  Let him take thee 
And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians 
Follow his chariot  like the greatest spot 
Of all thy sex  most monsterlike  be shown 
For poorst diminutives  for doits  and let 
Patient Octavia plough thy visage up 
With her prepared nails 

Tis well thourt gone 
If it be well to live  but better twere 
Thou fellst into my fury  for one death 
Might have prevented many  Eros  ho 
The shirt of Nessus is upon me  teach me 
Alcides  thou mine ancestor  thy rage 
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o the moon 
And with those hands  that graspd the heaviest club 
Subdue my worthiest self  The witch shall die 
To the young Roman boy she hath sold me  and I fall 
Under this plot  she dies for t  Eros  ho 

Help me  my women  O  he is more mad 
Than Telamon for his shield  the boar of Thessaly 
Was never so embossd 

To the monument 
There lock yourself  and send him word you are dead 
The soul and body rive not more in parting 
Than greatness going off 

To the monument 
Mardian  go tell him I have slain myself 
Say that the last I spoke was Antony  
And word it  prithee  piteously  Hence 
Mardian  and bring me how he takes my death 
To the monument 

Eros  thou yet beholdst me 

Ay  noble lord 

Sometimes we see a cloud thats dragonish 
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion 
A towerd citadel  a pendant rock 
A forked mountain  or blue promontory 
With trees upon t  that nod unto the world 
And mock our eyes with air  thou hast seen these signs 
They are black vespers pageants 

Ay  my lord 

That which is now a horse  even with a thought 
The rack dislimns  and makes it indistinct 
As water is in water 

It does  my lord 

My good knave  Eros  now thy captain is 
Even such a body  here I am Antony 
Yet cannot hold this visible shape  my knave 
I made these wars for Egypt  and the queen 
Whose heart I thought I had  for she had mine 
Which whilst it was mine had annexd unto t 
A million more  now lost  she  Eros  has 
Packd cards with C sar  and falseplayd my glory 
Unto an enemys triumph 
Nay  weep not  gentle Eros  there is left us 
Ourselves to end ourselves 


O  thy vile lady 

She has robbd me of my sword 

No  Antony 
My mistress lovd thee  and her fortunes mingled 
With thine entirely 

Hence  saucy eunuch  peace 
She hath betrayd me and shall die the death 

Death of one person can be paid but once 
And that she has dischargd  What thou wouldst do 
Is done unto thy hand  the last she spake 
Was  Antony  most noble Antony  
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break 
The name of Antony  it was divided 
Between her heart and lips  She renderd life 
Thy name so buried in her 

Dead  then 

Dead 

Unarm  Eros  the long days task is done 
And we must sleep 

That thou departst hence safe 
Does pay thy labour richly  go 

Off  pluck off 
The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep 
The battery from my heart  O  cleave  my sides 
Heart  once be stronger than thy continent 
Crack thy frail case  Apace  Eros  apace 
No more a soldier  bruised pieces  go 
You have been nobly borne  From me awhile 

I will oertake thee  Cleopatra  and 
Weep for my pardon  So it must be  for now 
All length is torture  since the torch is out 
Lie down  and stray no further  Now all labour 
Mars what it does  yea  very force entangles 
Itself with strength  seal then  and all is done 
Eros I come  my queen Eros Stay for me 
Where souls do couch on flowers  well hand in hand 
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze 
Dido and her  neas shall want troops 
And all the haunt be ours  Come  Eros  Eros 


What would my lord 

Since Cleopatra died 
I have livd in such dishonour  that the gods 
Detest my baseness  I  that with my sword 
Quarterd the world  and oer green Neptunes back 
With ships made cities  condemn myself to lack 
The courage of a woman  less noble mind 
Than she  which by her death our C sar tells 
I am conqueror of myself  Thou art sworn  Eros 
That  when the exigent should come which now 
Is come indeed when I should see behind me 
The inevitable prosecution of 
Disgrace and horror  that  on my command 
Thou then wouldst kill me  do t  the time is come 
Thou strikst not me  tis C sar thou defeatst 
Put colour in thy cheek 

The gods withhold me 
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts 
Though enemy  lost aim and could not 

Eros 
Wouldst thou be windowd in great Rome  and see 
Thy master thus with pleachd arms  bending down 
His corrigible neck  his face subdud 
To penetrative shame  whilst the wheeld seat 
Of fortunate C sar  drawn before him  branded 
His baseness that ensud 

I would not seet 

Come  then  for with a wound I must be curd 
Draw that thy honest sword  which thou hast worn 
Most useful for thy country 

O  sir  pardon me 

When I did make thee free  sworst thou not then 
To do this when I bade thee  Do it at once 
Or thy precedent services are all 
But accidents unpurposd  Draw  and come 

Turn from me then that noble countenance 
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies 

Lo thee 


My sword is drawn 

Then let it do at once 
The thing why thou hast drawn it 

My dear master 
My captain  and my emperor  let me say 
Before I strike this bloody stroke  farewell 

Tis said  man  and farewell 

Farewell  great chief  Shall I strike now 

Now  Eros 

Why  there then  thus do I escape the sorrow 

Of Antonys death 

Thricenobler than myself 
Thou teachest me  O valiant Eros  what 
I should  and thou couldst not  My queen and Eros 
Have by their brave instruction got upon me 
A nobleness in record  but I will be 
A bridegroom in my death  and run into t 
As to a lovers bed  Come  then  and  Eros 
Thy master dies thy scholar  to do thus 

I learnd of thee  How  not dead  not dead 
The guard  ho  O  dispatch me 


Whats the noise 

I have done my work ill  friends  O  make an end 
Of what I have begun 

The star is fallen 

And time is at his period 

Alas  and woe 

Let him that loves me strike me dead 

Not I 

Nor I 

Nor any one 


Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly 
This sword but shown to C sar  with this tidings 
Shall enter me with him 


Wheres Antony 

There  Diomed  there 

Lives he 
Wilt thou not answer  man 


Art thou there  Diomed  Draw thy sword  and give me 
Sufficing strokes for death 

Most absolute lord 
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee 

When did she send thee 

Now  my lord 

Where is she 

Lockd in her monument  She had a prophesying fear 
Of what hath come to pass  for when she saw 
Which never shall be found you did suspect 
She had disposd with C sar  and that your rage 
Would not be purgd  she sent you word she was dead 
But  fearing since how it might work  hath sent 
Me to proclaim the truth  and I am come 
I dread  too late 

Too late  good Diomed  Call my guard  I prithee 

What  ho  the emperors guard  The guard  what  ho 
Come  your lord calls 


Bear me  good friends  where Cleopatra bides 
Tis the last service that I shall command you 

Woe  woe are we  sir  you may not live to wear 
All your true followers out 

Most heavy day 

Nay  good my fellows  do not please sharp fate 
To grace it with your sorrows  bid that welcome 
Which comes to punish us  and we punish it 
Seeming to bear it lightly  Take me up 
I have led you oft  carry me now  good friends 
And have my thanks for all 

O Charmian  I will never go from hence 

Be comforted  dear madam 

No  I will not 
All strange and terrible events are welcome 
But comforts we despise  our size of sorrow 
Proportiond to our cause  must be as great 
As that which makes it 

How now  is he dead 

His deaths upon him  but not dead 
Look out o the other side your monument 
His guard have brought him thither 


O sun 
Burn the great sphere thou movst in  darkling stand 
The varying star o the world  O Antony 
Antony  Antony  Help  Charmian  help  Iras  help 
Help  friends below  lets draw him hither 

Peace 
Not C sars valour hath oerthrown Antony 
But Antonys hath triumphd on itself 

So it should be  that none but Antony 
Should conquer Antony  but woe tis so 

I am dying  Egypt  dying  only 
I here importune death awhile  until 
Of many thousand kisses the poor last 
I lay upon thy lips 

I dare not  dear 
Dear my lord  pardon I dare not 
Lest I be taken  not the imperious show 
Of the fullfortund C sar ever shall 
Be broochd with me  if knife  drugs  serpents  have 
Edge  sting  or operation  I am safe 
Your wife Octavia  with her modest eyes 
And still conclusion  shall acquire no honour 
Demuring upon me  But come  come  Antony 
Help me  my women we must draw thee up 
Assist  good friends 

O  quick  or I am gone 

Heres sport indeed  How heavy weighs my lord 
Our strength is all gone into heaviness 
That makes the weight  Had I great Junos power 
The strongwingd Mercury should fetch thee up 
And set thee by Joves side  Yet come a little 
Wishers were ever fools  O  come  come  come 

And welcome  welcome  die where thou hastlivd 
Quicken with kissing  had my lips that power 
Thus would I wear them out 

A heavy sight 

I am dying  Egypt  dying 
Give me some wine  and let me speak a little 

No  let me speak  and let me rail so high 
That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel 
Provokd by my offence 

One word  sweet queen 
Of C sar seek your honour with your safety  O 

They do not go together 

Gentle  hear me 
None about C sar trust  but Proculeius 

My resolution and my hands Ill trust 
None about C sar 

The miserable change now at my end 
Lament nor sorrow at  but please your thoughts 
In feeding them with those my former fortunes 
Wherein I livd  the greatest prince o the world 
The noblest  and do now not basely die 
Not cowardly put off my helmet to 
My countryman  a Roman by a Roman 
Valiantly vanquishd  Now my spirit is going 
I can no more 

Noblest of men  woo t die 
Hast thou no care of me  shall I abide 
In this dull world  which in thy absence is 
No better than a sty  O  see my women 

The crown o the earth doth melt  My lord 
O  witherd is the garland of the war 
The soldiers pole is falln  young boys and girls 
Are level now with men  the odds is gone 
And there is nothing left remarkable 
Beneath the visiting moon 


O  quietness  lady 

She is dead too  our sovereign 

Lady 

Madam 

O madam  madam  madam 

Royal Egypt 
Empress 

Peace  peace  Iras 

No more  but een a woman  and commanded 
By such poor passion as the maid that milks 
And does the meanest chares  It were for me 
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods 
To tell them that this world did equal theirs 
Till they had stoln our jewel  Alls but naught 
Patience is sottish  and impatience does 
Become a dog thats mad  then is it sin 
To rush into the secret house of death 
Ere death dare come to us  How do you  women 
What  what  good cheer  Why  how now  Charmian 
My noble girls  Ah  women  women  look 
Our lamp is spent  its out  Good sirs  take heart 
Well bury him  and then  whats brave  whats noble 
Lets do it after the high Roman fashion 
And make death proud to take us  Come  away 
This case of that huge spirit now is cold 
Ah  women  women  Come  we have no friend 
But resolution  and the briefest end 

Go to him  Dolabella  bid him yield 
Being so frustrate  tell him he mocks 
The pauses that he makes 

C sar  I shall 

Wherefore is that  and what art thou that darst 
Appear thus to us 

I am calld Dercetas 
Mark Antony I servd  who best was worthy 
Best to be servd  whilst he stood up and spoke 
He was my master  and I wore my life 
To spend upon his haters  If thou please 
To take me to thee  as I was to him 
Ill be to C sar  if thou pleasest not 
I yield thee up my life 

What is t thou sayst 

I say  O C sar  Antony is dead 

The breaking of so great a thing should make 
A greater crack  the round world 
Should have shook lions into civil streets 
And citizens to their dens  The death of Antony 
Is not a single doom  in the name lay 
A moiety of the world 

He is dead  C sar 
Not by a public minister of justice 
Nor by a hired knife  but that self hand 
Which writ his honour in the acts it did 
Hath  with the courage which the heart did lend it 
Splitted the heart  This is his sword 
I robbd his wound of it  behold it staind 
With his most noble blood 

Look you sad  friends 
The gods rebuke me  but it is tidings 
To wash the eyes of kings 

And strange it is 
That nature must compel us to lament 
Our most persisted deeds 

His taints and honours 
Wagd equal with him 

A rarer spirit never 
Did steer humanity  but you  gods  will give us 
Some faults to make us men  C sar is touchd 

When such a spacious mirrors set before him 
He needs must see himself 

O Antony 
I have followd thee to this  but we do lance 
Diseases in our bodies  I must perforce 
Have shown to thee such a declining day 
Or look on thine  we could not stall together 
In the whole world  But yet let me lament 
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts 
That thou  my brother  my competitor 
In top of all design  my mate in empire 
Friend and companion in the front of war 
The arm of mine own body  and the heart 
Where mine his thoughts did kindle  that our stars 
Unreconciliable  should divide 
Our equalness to this  Hear me  good friends 


But I will tell you at some meeter season 
The business of this man looks out of him 

Well hear him what he says  Whence are you 

A poor Egyptian yet  The queen my mistress 
Confind in all she has  her monument 
Of thy intents desires instruction 
That she preparedly may frame herself 
To the way shes forcd to 

Bid her have good heart 
She soon shall know of us  by some of ours 
How honourable and how kindly we 
Determine for her  for C sar cannot live 
To be ungentle 

So the gods preserve thee 


Come hither  Proculeius  Go and say 
We purpose her no shame  give her what comforts 
The quality of her passion shall require 
Lest  in her greatness  by some mortal stroke 
She do defeat us  for her life in Rome 
Would be eternal in our triumph  Go 
And with your speediest bring us what she says 
And how you find of her 

C sar  I shall 


Gallus  go you along 

To second Proculeius 

Dolabella 

Dolabella 

Let him alone  for I remember now 
How hes employd  he shall in time be ready 
Go with me to my tent  where you shall see 
How hardly I was drawn into this war 
How calm and gentle I proceeded still 
In all my writings  Go with me  and see 
What I can show in this 


My desolation does begin to make 
A better life  Tis paltry to be C sar 
Not being Fortune  hes but Fortunes knave 
A minister of her will  and it is great 
To do that thing that ends all other deeds 
Which shackles accidents  and bolts up change 
Which sleeps  and never palates more the dug 
The beggars nurse and C sars 


C sar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt 
And bids thee study on what fair demands 
Thou meanst to have him grant thee 

Whats thy name 

My name is Proculeius 

Antony 
Did tell me of you  bade me trust you  but 
I do not greatly care to be deceivd 
That have no use for trusting  If your master 
Would have a queen his beggar  you must tell him 
That majesty  to keep decorum  must 
No less beg than a kingdom  if he please 
To give me conquerd Egypt for my son 
He gives me so much of mine own as I 
Will kneel to him with thanks 

Be of good cheer 
Youre falln into a princely hand  fear nothing 
Make your full reference freely to my lord 
Who is so full of grace  that it flows over 
On all that need  let me report to him 
Your sweet dependancy  and you shall find 
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness 
Where he for grace is kneeld to 

Pray you  tell him 
I am his fortunes vassal  and I send him 
The greatness he has got  I hourly learn 
A doctrine of obedience  and would gladly 
Look him i the face 

This Ill report  dear lady 
Have comfort  for I know your plight is pitied 
Of him that causd it 

You see how easily she may be surprisd 


Guard her till C sar come 

Royal queen 

O Cleopatra  thou art taken  queen 

Quick  quick  good hands 


Hold  worthy lady  hold 

Do not yourself such wrong  who are in this 
Relievd  but not betrayd 

What  of death too 
That rids our dogs of languish 

Cleopatra 
Do not abuse my masters bounty by 
The undoing of yourself  let the world see 
His nobleness well acted  which your death 
Will never let come forth 

Where art thou  death 
Come hither  come  come  come  and take a queen 
Worth many babes and beggars 

O  temperance  lady 

Sir  I will eat no meat  Ill not drink  sir 
If idle talk will once be necessary 
Ill not sleep neither  This mortal house Ill ruin 
Do C sar what he can  Know  sir  that I 
Will not wait piniond at your masters court 
Nor once be chastisd with the sober eye 
Of dull Octavia  Shall they hoist me up 
And show me to the shouting varletry 
Of censuring Rome  Rather a ditch in Egypt 
Be gentle grave unto me  rather on Nilus mud 
Lay me stark nakd  and let the waterflies 
Blow me into abhorring  rather make 
My countrys high pyramides my gibbet 
And hang me up in chains 

You do extend 
These thoughts of horror further than you shall 
Find cause in C sar 


Proculeius 
What thou hast done thy master C sar knows 
And he hath sent for thee  as for the queen 
Ill take her to my guard 

So  Dolabella 
It shall content me best  be gentle to her 


To C sar I will speak what you shall please 
If youll employ me to him 

Say  I would die 


Most noble empress  you have heard of me 

I cannot tell 

Assuredly you know me 

No matter  sir  what I have heard or known 
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams 
Is t not your trick 

I understand not  madam 

I dreamd there was an Emperor Antony 
O  such another sleep  that I might see 
But such another man 

If it might please ye 

His face was as the heavens  and therein stuck 
A sun and moon  which kept their course  and lighted 
The little O  the earth 

Most sovereign creature 

His legs besfrid the ocean  his reard arm 
Crested the world  his voice was propertied 
As all the tuned spheres  and that to friends 
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb 
He was as rattling thunder  For his bounty 
There was no winter in t  an autumn twas 
That grew the more by reaping  his delights 
Were dolphinlike  they showd his back above 
The element they livd in  in his livery 
Walkd crowns and crownets  realms and islands were 
As plates droppd from his pocket 

Cleopatra 

Think you there was  or might be  such a man 
As this I dreamd of 

Gentle madam  no 

You lie  up to the hearing of the gods 
But  if there be  or ever were  one such 
Its past the size of dreaming  nature wants stuff 
To vie strange forms with fancy  yet to imagine 
An Antony were natures piece gainst fancy 
Condemning shadows quite 

Hear me  good madam 
Your loss is as yourself  great  and you bear it 
As answering to the weight  would I might never 
Oertake pursud success  but I do feel 
By the rebound of yours  a grief that smites 
My very heart at root 

I thank you  sir 
Know you what C sar means to do with me 

I am loath to tell you what I would you knew 

Nay  pray you  sir 

Though he be honourable 

Hell lead me then in triumph 

Madam  he will  I know t 

Which is the Queen of Egypt 

It is the emperor  madam 


Arise  you shall not kneel 
I pray you  rise  rise  Egypt 

Sir  the gods 
Will have it thus  my master and my lord 
I must obey 

Take to you no hard thoughts 
The record of what injuries you did us 
Though written in our flesh  we shall remember 
As things but done by chance 

Sole sir o the world 
I cannot project mine own cause so well 
To make it clear  but do confess I have 
Been laden with like frailties which before 
Have often shamd our sex 

Cleopatra  know 
We will extenuate rather than enforce 
If you apply yourself to our intents 
Which towards you are most gentle you shall find 
A benefit in this change  but if you seek 
To lay on me a cruelty  by taking 
Antonys course  you shall bereave yourself 
Of my good purposes  and put your children 
To that destruction which Ill guard them from 
If thereon you rely  Ill take my leave 

And may through all the world  tis yours  and we 
Your scutcheons  and your signs of conquest  shall 
Hang in what place you please  Here  my good lord 

You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra 

This is the brief of money  plate  and jewels 
I am possessd of  tis exactly valued 
Not petty things admitted  Wheres Seleucus 

Here  madam 

This is my treasurer  let him speak  my lord 
Upon his peril  that I have reservd 
To myself nothing  Speak the truth  Seleucus 

Madam 
I had rather seal my lips  than  to my peril 
Speak that which is not 

What have I kept back 

Enough to purchase what you have made known 

Nay  blush not  Cleopatra  I approve 
Your wisdom in the deed 

See  C sar  O  behold 
How pomp is followd  mine will now be yours 
And  should we shift estates  yours would be mine 
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does 
Even make me wild  O slave  of no more trust 
Than love thats hird  What  goest thou back  thou shalt 
Go back  I warrant thee  but Ill catch thine eyes 
Though they had wings  slave  soulless villain  dog 
O rarely base 

Good queen  let us entreat you 

O C sar  what a wounding shame is this 
That thou  vouchsafing here to visit me 
Doing the honour of thy lordliness 
To one so meek  that mine own servant should 
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by 
Addition of his envy  Say  good C sar 
That I some lady trifles have reservd 
Immoment toys  things of such dignity 
As we greet modern friends withal  and say 
Some nobler token I have kept apart 
For Livia and Octavia  to induce 
Their mediation  must I be unfolded 
With one that I have bred  The gods  it smites me 
Beneath the fall I have 

Prithee  go hence 
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits 
Through the ashes of my chance  Wert thou a man 
Thou wouldst have mercy on me 

Forbear  Seleucus 


Be it known that we  the greatest  are misthought 
For things that others do  and  when we fall 
We answer others merits in our name 
Are therefore to be pitied 

Cleopatra 
Not what you have reservd  nor what acknowledgd 
Put we i the roll of conquest  still be t yours 
Bestow it at your pleasure  and believe 
C sars no merchant  to make prize with you 
Of things that merchants sold  Therefore be cheerd 
Make not your thoughts your prisons  no  dear queen 
For we intend so to dispose you as 
Yourself shall give us counsel  Feed  and sleep 
Our care and pity is so much upon you 
That we remain your friend  and so  adieu 

My master  and my lord 

Not so  Adieu 


He words me  girls  he words me  that I should not 
Be noble to myself  but  hark thee  Charmian 


Finish  good lady  the bright day is done 
And we are for the dark 

Hie thee again 
I have spoke already  and it is provided 
Go  put it to the haste 

Madam  I will 


Where is the queen 

Behold  sir 


Dolabella 

Madam  as thereto sworn by your command 
Which my love makes religion to obey 
I tell you this  C sar through Syria 
Intends his journey  and within three days 
You with your children will be send before 
Make your best use of this  I have performd 
Your pleasure and my promise 

Dolabella 
I shall remain your debtor 

I your servant 
Adieu  good queen  I must attend on C sar 

Farewell  and thanks 

Now  Iras  what thinkst thou 
Thou  an Egyptian puppet  shall be shown 
In Rome  as well as I  mechanic slaves 
With greasy aprons  rules and hammers  shall 
Uplift us to the view  in their thick breaths 
Rank of gross diet  shall we be enclouded 
And forcd to drink their vapour 

The gods forbid 

Nay  tis most certain  Iras  Saucy lictors 
Will catch at us  like strumpets  and scald rimers 
Ballad us out o tune  the quick comedians 
Extemporally will stage us  and present 
Our Alexandrian revels  Antony 
Shall be brought drunken forth  and I shall see 
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness 
I the posture of a whore 

O  the good gods 

Nay  thats certain 

Ill never see it  for  I am sure my nails 
Are stronger than mine eyes 

Why  thats the way 
To fool their preparation  and to conquer 
Their most absurd intents 


Now  Charmian 
Show me  my women  like a queen  go fetch 
My best attires  I am again for Cydnus 
To meet Mark Antony  Sirrah Iras  go 
Now  noble Charmian  well dispatch indeed 
And  when thou hast done this chare  Ill give thee leave 
To play till doomsday  Bring our crown and all 

Wherefores this noise 

Here is a rural fellow 
That will not be denied your highness presence 
He brings you figs 

Let him come in 

What poor an instrument 
May do a noble deed  he brings me liberty 
My resolutions placd  and I have nothing 
Of woman in me  now from head to foot 
I am marbleconstant  now the fleeting moon 
No planet is of mine 


This is the man 

Avoid  and leave him 

Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there 
That kills and pains not 

Truly  I have him  but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him  for his biting is immortal  those that do die of it do seldom or never recover 

Rememberst thou any that have died on t 

Very many  men and women too  I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday  a very honest woman  but something given to lie  as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty  how she died of the biting of it  what pain she felt  Truly  she makes a very good report o the worm  but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do  But this is most fallible  the worms an odd worm 

Get thee hence  farewell 

I wish you all joy of the worm 


Farewell 

You must think this  look you  that the worm will do his kind 

Ay  ay  farewell 

Look you  the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people  for indeed there is no goodness in the worm 

Take thou no care  it shall be heeded 

Very good  Give it nothing  I pray you  for it is not worth the feeding 

Will it eat me 

You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman  I know that a woman is a dish for the gods  if the devil dress her not  But  truly  these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women  for in every ten that they make  the devils mar five 

Well  get thee gone  farewell 

Yes  forsooth  I wish you joy of the worm 

Give me my robe  put on my crown  I have 
Immortal longings in me  now no more 
The juice of Egypts grape shall moist this lip 
Yare  yare  good Iras  quick  Methinks I hear 
Antony call  I see him rouse himself 
To praise my noble act  I hear him mock 
The luck of C sar  which the gods give men 
To excuse their after wrath  husband  I come 
Now to that name my courage prove my title 
I am fire  and air  my other elements 
I give to baser life  So  have you done 
Come then  and take the last warmth of my lips 
Farewell  kind Charmian  Iras  long farewell 

Have I the aspic in my lips  Dost fall 
If thou and nature can so gently part 
The stroke of death is as a lovers pinch 
Which hurts  and is desird  Dost thou lie still 
If thus thou vanishest  thou tellst the world 
It is not worth leavetaking 

Dissolve  thick cloud  and rain  that I may say 
The gods themselves do weep 

This proves me base 
If she first meet the curled Antony 
Hell make demand of her  and spend that kiss 
Which is my heaven to have  Come  thou mortal wretch 

With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate 
Of life at once untie  poor venomous fool 
Be angry  and dispatch  O  couldst thou speak 
That I might hear thee call great C sar ass 
Unpolicied 

O eastern star 

Peace  peace 
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast 
That sucks the nurse asleep 

O  break  O  break 

As sweet as balm  as soft as air  as gentle 
O Antony Nay  I will take thee too 

What should I stay 


In this vile world  So  fare thee well 
Now boast thee  death  in thy possession lies 
A lass unparalleld  Downy windows  close 
And golden Ph bus never be beheld 
Of eyes again so royal  Your crowns awry 
Ill mend it  and then play 


Where is the queen 

Speak softly  wake her not 

C sar hath sent 

Too slow a messenger 

O  come apace  dispatch  I partly feel thee 

Approach  ho  Alls not well  C sars beguild 

Theres Dolabella sent from C sar  call him 

What work is here  Charmian  is this well done 

It is well done  and fitting for a princess 
Descended of so many royal kings 
Ah  soldier 

How goes it here 

All dead 

C sar  thy thoughts 
Touch their effects in this  thyself art coming 
To see performd the dreaded act which thou 
So soughtst to hinder 

O  sir  you are too sure an augurer 
That you did fear is done 

Bravest at the last 
She levelld at our purposes  and  being royal 
Took her own way  The manner of their deaths 
I do not see them bleed 

Who was last with them 

A simple countryman that brought her figs 
This was his basket 

Poisond then 

O C sar 
This Charmian livd but now  she stood  and spake 
I found her trimming up the diadem 
On her dead mistress  tremblingly she stood 
And on the sudden droppd 

O noble weakness 
If they had swallowd poison twould appear 
By external swelling  but she looks like sleep 
As she would catch another Antony 
In her strong toil of grace 

Here  on her breast 
There is a vent of blood  and something blown 
The like is on her arm 

This is an aspics trail  and these figleaves 
Have slime upon them  such as the aspic leaves 
Upon the caves of Nile 

Most probable 
That so she died  for her physician tells me 
She hath pursud conclusions infinite 
Of easy ways to die  Take up her bed 
And bear her women from the monument 
She shall be buried by her Antony 
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it 
A pair so famous  High events as these 
Strike those that make them  and their story is 
No less in pity than his glory which 
Brought them to be lamented  Our army shall 
In solemn show  attend this funeral 
And then to Rome  Come  Dolabella  see 
High order in this great solemnity
