THE TRAGEDY OF KING RICHARD III

Now is the winter of our discontent 
Made glorious summer by this sun of York 
And all the clouds that lourd upon our house 
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried 
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths 
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments 
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings 
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures 
Grimvisagd war hath smoothd his wrinkled front 
And now instead of mounting barbed steeds 
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries 
He capers nimbly in a ladys chamber 
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute 
But I  that am not shapd for sportive tricks 
Nor made to court an amorous lookingglass 
I  that am rudely stampd  and want loves majesty 
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph 
I  that am curtaild of this fair proportion 
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature 
Deformd  unfinishd  sent before my time 
Into this breathing world  scarce half made up 
And that so lamely and unfashionable 
That dogs bark at me  as I halt by them 
Why  I  in this weak piping time of peace 
Have no delight to pass away the time 
Unless to see my shadow in the sun 
And descant on mine own deformity 
And therefore  since I cannot prove a lover 
To entertain these fair wellspoken days 
I am determined to prove a villain 
And hate the idle pleasures of these days 
Plots have I laid  inductions dangerous 
By drunken prophecies  libels  and dreams 
To set my brother Clarence and the king 
In deadly hate the one against the other 
And if King Edward be as true and just 
As I am subtle  false  and treacherous 
This day should Clarence closely be mewd up 
About a prophecy  which says  that G 
Of Edwards heirs the murderer shall be 
Dive  thoughts  down to my soul  here Clarence comes 


Brother  good day  what means this armed guard 

That waits upon your Grace 

His majesty 
Tendering my persons safety  hath appointed 
This conduct to convey me to the Tower 

Upon what cause 

Because my name is George 

Alack  my lord  that fault is none of yours 
He should  for that  commit your godfathers 
O  belike his majesty hath some intent 
That you should be newchristend in the Tower 
But whats the matter  Clarence  may I know 

Yea  Richard  when I know  for I protest 
As yet I do not  but  as I can learn 
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams 
And from the crossrow plucks the letter G 
And says a wizard told him that by G 
His issue disinherited should be 
And  for my name of George begins with G 
It follows in his thought that I am he 
These  as I learn  and such like toys as these 
Have movd his highness to commit me now 

Why  this it is  when men are ruld by women 
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower 
My Lady Grey  his wife  Clarence  tis she 
That tempers him to this extremity 
Was it not she and that good man of worship 
Antony Woodville  her brother there 
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower 
From whence this present day he is deliverd 
We are not safe  Clarence  we are not safe 

By heaven  I think there is no man secure 
But the queens kindred and nightwalking heralds 
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore 
Heard you not what a humble suppliant 
Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery 

Humbly complaining to her deity 
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty 
Ill tell you what  I think it is our way 
If we will keep in favour with the king 
To be her men and wear her livery 
The jealous oerworn widow and herself 
Since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen 
Are mighty gossips in our monarchy 

I beseech your Graces both to pardon me 
His majesty hath straitly given in charge 
That no man shall have private conference 
Of what degree soever  with your brother 

Even so  an please your worship  Brakenbury 
You may partake of anything we say 
We speak no treason  man  we say the king 
Is wise and virtuous  and his noble queen 
Well struck in years  fair  and not jealous 
We say that Shores wife hath a pretty foot 
A cherry lip  a bonny eye  a passing pleasing tongue 
And that the queens kindred are made gentlefolks 
How say you  sir  can you deny all this 

With this  my lord  myself have nought to do 

Naught to do with Mistress Shore  I tell thee  fellow 
He that doth naught with her  excepting one 
Were best to do it secretly  alone 

What one  my lord 

Her husband  knave  Wouldst thou betray me 

I beseech your Grace to pardon me  and withal 
Forbear your conference with the noble duke 

We know thy charge  Brakenbury  and will obey 

We are the queens abjects  and must obey 
Brother  farewell  I will unto the king 
And whatsoeer you will employ me in 
Were it to call King Edwards widow sister 
I will perform it to enfranchise you 
Meantime  this deep disgrace in brotherhood 
Touches me deeper than you can imagine 

I know it pleaseth neither of us well 

Well  your imprisonment shall not be long 
I will deliver you  or else lie for you 
Meantime  have patience 

I must perforce  farewell 


Go  tread the path that thou shalt neer return 
Simple  plain Clarence  I do love thee so 
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven 
If heaven will take the present at our hands 
But who comes here  the newdeliverd Hastings 


Good time of day unto my gracious lord 

As much unto my good lord chamberlain 
Well are you welcome to this open air 
How hath your lordship brookd imprisonment 

With patience  noble lord  as prisoners must 
But I shall live  my lord  to give them thanks 
That were the cause of my imprisonment 

No doubt  no doubt  and so shall Clarence too 
For they that were your enemies are his 
And have prevaild as much on him as you 

More pity that the eagles should be mewd 
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty 

What news abroad 

No news so bad abroad as this at home 
The king is sickly  weak  and melancholy 
And his physicians fear him mightily 

Now by Saint Paul  this news is bad indeed 
O  he hath kept an evil diet long 
And overmuch consumd his royal person 
Tis very grievous to be thought upon 
What  is he in his bed 

He is 

Go you before  and I will follow you 

He cannot live  I hope  and must not die 
Till George be packd with posthorse up to heaven 
Ill in  to urge his hatred more to Clarence 
With lies well steeld with weighty arguments 
And  if I fail not in my deep intent 
Clarence hath not another day to live 
Which done  God take King Edward to his mercy 
And leave the world for me to bustle in 
For then Ill marry Warwicks youngest daughter 
What though I killd her husband and her father 
The readiest way to make the wench amends 
Is to become her husband and her father 
The which will I  not all so much for love 
As for another secret close intent 
By marrying her  which I must reach unto 
But yet I run before my horse to market 
Clarence still breathes  Edward still lives and reigns 
When they are gone  then must I count my gains 

Set down  set down your honourable load 
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse 
Whilst I a while obsequiously lament 
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster 
Poor keycold figure of a holy king 
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster 
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood 
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost 
To hear the lamentations of poor Anne 
Wife to thy Edward  to thy slaughterd son 
Stabbd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds 
Lo  in these windows that let forth thy life 
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes 
O  cursed be the hand that made these holes 
Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it 
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence 
More direful hap betide that hated wretch 
That makes us wretched by the death of thee 
Than I can wish to adders  spiders  toads 
Or any creeping venomd thing that lives 
If ever he have child  abortive be it 
Prodigious  and untimely brought to light 
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect 
May fright the hopeful mother at the view 
And that be heir to his unhappiness 
If ever he have wife  let her be made 
More miserable by the death of him 
Than I am made by my young lord and thee 
Come  now toward Chertsey with your holy load 
Taken from Pauls to be interred there 
And still  as you are weary of the weight 
Rest you  whiles I lament King Henrys corse 

Stay  you that bear the corse  and set it down 

What black magician conjures up this fiend 
To stop devoted charitable deeds 

Villains  set down the corse  or  by Saint Paul 
Ill make a corse of him that disobeys 

My lord  stand back  and let the coffin pass 

Unmannerd dog  stand thou when I command 
Advance thy halberd higher than my breast 
Or  by Saint Paul  Ill strike thee to my foot 
And spurn upon thee  beggar  for thy boldness 


What  do you tremble  are you all afraid 
Alas  I blame you not  for you are mortal 
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil 
Avaunt  thou dreadful minister of hell 
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body 
His soul thou canst not have  therefore  be gone 

Sweet saint  for charity  be not so curst 

Foul devil  for Gods sake hence  and trouble us not 
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell 
Filld it with cursing cries and deep exclaims 
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds 
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries 
O  gentlemen  see  see  dead Henrys wounds 
Open their congeald mouths and bleed afresh 
Blush  blush  thou lump of foul deformity 
For tis thy presence that exhales this blood 
From cold and empty veins  where no blood dwells 
Thy deed  inhuman and unnatural 
Provokes this deluge most unnatural 
O God  which this blood madst  revenge his death 
O earth  which this blood drinkst  revenge his death 
Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead 
Or earth  gape open wide  and eat him quick 
As thou dost swallow up this good kings blood 
Which his hellgovernd arm hath butchered 

Lady  you know no rules of charity 
Which renders good for bad  blessings for curses 

Villain  thou knowst no law of God nor man 
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity 

But I know none  and therefore am no beast 

O  wonderful  when devils tell the truth 

More wonderful when angels are so angry 
Vouchsafe  divine perfection of a woman 
Of these supposed evils  to give me leave 
By circumstance  but to acquit myself 

Vouchsafe  diffusd infection of a man 
For these known evils  but to give me leave 
By circumstance  to curse thy cursed self 

Fairer than tongue can name thee  let me have 
Some patient leisure to excuse myself 

Fouler than heart can think thee  thou canst make 
No excuse current  but to hang thyself 

By such despair I should accuse myself 

And by despairing shouldst thou stand excusd 
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself 
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others 

Say that I slew them not 

Then say they were not slain 
But dead they are  and  devilish slave  by thee 

I did not kill your husband 

Why  then he is alive 

Nay  he is dead  and slain by Edwards hand 

In thy foul throat thou liest  Queen Margaret saw 
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood 
The which thou once didst bend against her breast 
But that thy brothers beat aside the point 

I was provoked by her slandrous tongue 
That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders 

Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind 
That never dreamt on aught but butcheries 
Didst thou not kill this king 

I grant ye 

Dost grant me  hedgehog  Then  God grant me too 
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed 
O  he was gentle  mild  and virtuous 

The fitter for the King of heaven  that hath him 

He is in heaven  where thou shalt never come 

Let him thank me  that helpd to send him thither 
For he was fitter for that place than earth 

And thou unfit for any place but hell 

Yes  one place else  if you will bear me name it 

Some dungeon 

Your bedchamber 

Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest 

So will it  madam  till I lie with you 

I hope so 

I know so  But  gentle Lady Anne 
To leave this keen encounter of our wits 
And fall somewhat into a slower method 
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths 
Of these Plantagenets  Henry and Edward 
As blameful as the executioner 

Thou wast the cause  and most accursd effect 

Your beauty was the cause of that effect 
Your beauty  that did haunt me in my sleep 
To undertake the death of all the world 
So might I live one hour in your sweet bosom 

If I thought that  I tell thee  homicide 
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks 

These eyes could not endure that beautys wrack 
You should not blemish it if I stood by 
As all the world is cheered by the sun 
So I by that  it is my day  my life 

Black night oershade thy day  and death thy life 

Curse not thyself  fair creature  thou art both 

I would I were  to be revengd on thee 

It is a quarrel most unnatural 
To be revengd on him that loveth thee 

It is a quarrel just and reasonable 
To be revengd on him that killd my husband 

He that bereft thee  lady  of thy husband 
Did it to help thee to a better husband 

His better doth not breathe upon the earth 

He lives that loves thee better than he could 

Name him 

Plantagenet 

Why  that was he 

The selfsame name  but one of better nature 

Where is he 

Here 

Why dost thou spit at me 

Would it were mortal poison  for thy sake 

Never came poison from so sweet a place 

Never hung poison on a fouler toad 
Out of my sight  thou dost infect mine eyes 

Thine eyes  sweet lady  have infected mine 

Would they were basilisks  to strike thee dead 

I would they were  that I might die at once 
For now they kill me with a living death 
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears 
Shamd their aspects with store of childish drops 
These eyes  which never shed remorseful tear 
No  when my father York and Edward wept 
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made 
When blackfacd Clifford shook his sword at him 
Nor when thy warlike father like a child 
Told the sad story of my fathers death 
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep 
That all the standersby had wet their cheeks 
Like trees bedashd with rain  in that sad time 
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear 
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale 
Thy beauty hath  and made them blind with weeping 
I never sud to friend  nor enemy 
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing words 
But  now thy beauty is proposd my fee 
My proud heart sues  and prompts my tongue to speak 

Teach not thy lip such scorn  for it was made 
For kissing  lady  not for such contempt 
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive 
Lo  here I lend thee this sharppointed sword 
Which if thou please to hide in this true breast 
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee 
I lay it open to the deadly stroke 
And humbly beg the death upon my knee 

Nay  do not pause  for I did kill King Henry 
But twas thy beauty that provoked me 
Nay  now dispatch  twas I that stabbd young Edward 

But twas thy heavenly face that set me on 

Take up the sword again  or take up me 

Arise  dissembler  though I wish thy death 
I will not be thy executioner 

Then bid me kill myself  and I will do it 

I have already 

That was in thy rage 
Speak it again  and  even with the word 
This hand  which for thy love did kill thy love 
Shall  for thy love  kill a far truer love 
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary 

I would I knew thy heart 

Tis figurd in my tongue 

I fear me both are false 

Then never man was true 

Well  well  put up your sword 

Say  then  my peace is made 

That shalt thou know hereafter 

But shall I live in hope 

All men  I hope  live so 

Vouchsafe to wear this ring 

To take is not to give 


Look  how my ring encompasseth thy finger 
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart 
Wear both of them  for both of them are thine 
And if thy poor devoted servant may 
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand 
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever 

What is it 

That it may please you leave these sad designs 
To him that hath most cause to be a mourner 
And presently repair to Crosbyplace 
Where  after I have solemnly interrd 
At Chertsey monastery this noble king 
And wet his grave with my repentant tears 
I will with all expedient duty see you 
For divers unknown reasons  I beseech you 
Grant me this boon 

With all my heart  and much it joys me too 
To see you are become so penitent 
Tressel and Berkeley  go along with me 

Bid me farewell 

Tis more than you deserve 
But since you teach me how to flatter you 
Imagine I have said farewell already 


Sirs  take up the corse 

Toward Chertsey  noble lord 

No  to WhiteFriars  there attend my coming 

Was ever woman in this humour wood 
Was ever woman in this humour won 
Ill have her  but I will not keep her long 
What  I  that killd her husband  and his father 
To take her in her hearts extremest hate 
With curses in her mouth  tears in her eyes 
The bleeding witness of her hatred by 
Having God  her conscience  and these bars against me 
And nothing I to back my suit withal 
But the plain devil and dissembling looks 
And yet to win her  all the world to nothing 
Ha 
Hath she forgot already that brave prince 
Edward  her lord  whom I  some three months since 
Stabbd in my angry mood at Tewksbury 
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman 
Framd in the prodigality of nature 
Young  valiant  wise  and  no doubt  right royal 
The spacious world cannot again afford 
And will she yet abase her eyes on me 
That croppd the golden prime of this sweet prince 
And made her widow to a woeful bed 
On me  whose all not equals Edwards moiety 
On me  that halt and am misshapen thus 
My dukedom to a beggarly denier 
I do mistake my person all this while 
Upon my life  she finds  although I cannot 
Myself to be a marvellous proper man 
Ill be at charges for a lookingglass 
And entertain a score or two of tailors 
To study fashions to adorn my body 
Since I am crept in favour with myself 
I will maintain it with some little cost 
But first Ill turn yon fellow in his grave 
And then return lamenting to my love 
Shine out  fair sun  till I have bought a glass 
That I may see my shadow as I pass 


Have patience  madam  theres no doubt his majesty 
Will soon recover his accustomd health 

In that you brook it ill  it makes him worse 
Therefore  for Gods sake  entertain good comfort 
And cheer his Grace with quick and merry words 

If he were dead  what would betide on me 

No other harm but loss of such a lord 

The loss of such a lord includes all harms 

The heavens have blessd you with a goodly son 
To be your comforter when he is gone 

Ah  he is young  and his minority 
Is put into the trust of Richard Gloucester 
A man that loves not me  nor none of you 

Is it concluded he shall be protector 

It is determind  not concluded yet 
But so it must be if the king miscarry 


Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Stanley 

Good time of day unto your royal Grace 

God make your majesty joyful as you have been 

The Countess Richmond  good my Lord of Stanley 
To your good prayer will scarcely say amen 
Yet  Stanley  notwithstanding shes your wife 
And loves not me  be you  good lord  assurd 
I hate not you for her proud arrogance 

I do beseech you  either not believe 
The envious slanders of her false accusers 
Or  if she be accusd on true report 
Bear with her weakness  which  I think  proceeds 
From wayward sickness  and no grounded malice 

Saw you the king today  my Lord of Stanley 

But now the Duke of Buckingham and I 
Are come from visiting his majesty 

What likelihood of his amendment  lords 

Madam  good hope  his Grace speaks cheerfully 

God grant him health  did you confer with him 

Ay  madam  he desires to make atonement 
Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers 
And between them and my lord chamberlain 
And sent to warn them to his royal presence 

Would all were well  But that will never be 
I fear our happiness is at the highest 


They do me wrong  and I will not endure it 
Who are they that complain unto the king 
That I  forsooth  am stern and love them not 
By holy Paul  they love his Grace but lightly 
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours 
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair 
Smile in mens faces  smooth  deceive  and cog 
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy 
I must be held a rancorous enemy 
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm 
But thus his simple truth must be abusd 
By silken  sly  insinuating Jacks 

To whom in all this presence speaks your Grace 

To thee  that hast nor honesty nor grace 
When have I injurd thee  when done thee wrong 
Or thee  or thee  or any of your faction 
A plague upon you all  His royal person 
Whom God preserve better than you would wish 
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathingwhile 
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints 

Brother of Gloucester  you mistake the matter 
The king  on his own royal disposition 
And not provokd by any suitor else 
Aiming  belike  at your interior hatred 
That in your outward action shows itself 
Against my children  brothers  and myself 
Makes him to send  that thereby he may gather 
The ground of your illwill  and so remove it 

I cannot tell  the world is grown so bad 
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch 
Since every Jack became a gentleman 
Theres many a gentle person made a Jack 

Come  come  we know your meaning  brother Gloucester 
You envy my advancement and my friends 
God grant we never may have need of you 

Meantime  God grants that we have need of you 
Our brother is imprisond by your means 
Myself disgracd  and the nobility 
Held in contempt  while great promotions 
Are daily given to ennoble those 
That scarce  some two days since  were worth a noble 

By him that raisd me to this careful height 
From that contented hap which I enjoyd 
I never did incense his majesty 
Against the Duke of Clarence  but have been 
An earnest advocate to plead for him 
My lord  you do me shameful injury 
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects 

You may deny that you were not the mean 
Of my Lord Hastings late imprisonment 

She may  my lord  for 

She may  Lord Rivers  why  who knows not so 
She may do more  sir  than denying that 
She may help you to many fair preferments 
And then deny her aiding hand therein 
And lay those honours on your high deserts 
What may she not  She may ay  marry  may she 

What  marry  may she 

What  marry  may she  marry with a king 
A bachelor  a handsome stripling too 
I wis your grandam had a worser match 

My Lord of Gloucester  I have too long borne 
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs 
By heaven  I will acquaint his majesty 
Of those gross taunts that oft I have endurd 
I had rather be a country servantmaid 
Than a great queen  with this condition 
To be so baited  scornd  and stormed at 
Small joy have I in being Englands queen 


And lessend be that small  God  I beseech him 
Thy honour  state  and seat is due to me 

What  threat you me with telling of the king 
Tell him  and spare not  look  what I have said 
I will avouch in presence of the king 
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower 
Tis time to speak  my pains are quite forgot 

Out  devil  I remember them too well 
Thou killdst my husband Henry in the Tower 
And Edward  my poor son  at Tewksbury 

Ere you were queen  ay  or your husband king 
I was a packhorse in his great affairs 
A weederout of his proud adversaries 
A liberal rewarder of his friends 
To royalize his blood I split mine own 

Ay  and much better blood than his  or thine 

In all which time you and your husband Grey 
Were factious for the house of Lancaster 
And  Rivers  so were you  Was not your husband 
In Margarets battle at Saint Albans slain 
Let me put in your minds  if you forget 
What you have been ere now  and what you are 
Withal  what I have been  and what I am 

A murderous villain  and so still thou art 

Poor Clarence did forsake his father  Warwick 
Ay  and forswore himself which Jesu pardon 

Which God revenge 

To fight on Edwards party for the crown 
And for his meed  poor lord  he is mewd up 
I would to God my heart were flint  like Edwards 
Or Edwards soft and pitiful  like mine 
I am too childishfoolish for this world 

Hie thee to hell for shame  and leave this world 
Thou cacodemon  there thy kingdom is 

My Lord of Gloucester  in those busy days 
Which here you urge to prove us enemies 
We followd then our lord  our lawful king 
So should we you  if you should be our king 

If I should be  I had rather be a pedlar 
Far be it from my heart the thought thereof 

As little joy  my lord  as you suppose 
You should enjoy  were you this countrys king 
As little joy you may suppose in me 
That I enjoy  being the queen thereof 

As little joy enjoys the queen thereof 
For I am she  and altogether joyless 
I can no longer hold me patient 

Hear me  you wrangling pirates  that fall out 
In sharing that which you have pilld from me 
Which of you trembles not that looks on me 
If not  that  I being queen  you bow like subjects 
Yet that  by you deposd  you quake like rebels 
Ah  gentle villain  do not turn away 

Foul wrinkled witch  what makst thou in my sight 

But repetition of what thou hast marrd 
That will I make before I let thee go 

Wert thou not banished on pain of death 

I was  but I do find more pain in banishment 
Than death can yield me here by my abode 
A husband and a son thou owst to me 
And thou  a kingdom  all of you  allegiance 
This sorrow that I have by right is yours 
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine 

The curse my noble father laid on thee 
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper 
And with thy scorns drewst rivers from his eyes 
And then  to dry them  gavst the duke a clout 
Steepd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland 
His curses  then from bitterness of soul 
Denouncd against thee  are all falln upon thee 
And God  not we  hath plagud thy bloody deed 

So just is God  to right the innocent 

O  twas the foulest deed to slay that babe 
And the most merciless  that eer was heard of 

Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported 

No man but prophesied revenge for it 

Northumberland  then present  wept to see it 

What  were you snarling all before I came 
Ready to catch each other by the throat 
And turn you all your hatred now on me 
Did Yorks dread curse prevail so much with heaven 
That Henrys death  my lovely Edwards death 
Their kingdoms loss  my woeful banishment 
Should all but answer for that peevish brat 
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven 
Why then  give way  dull clouds  to my quick curses 
Though not by war  by surfeit die your king 
As ours by murder  to make him a king 
Edward  thy son  that now is Prince of Wales 
For Edward  my son  which was Prince of Wales 
Die in his youth by like untimely violence 
Thyself a queen  for me that was a queen 
Outlive thy glory  like my wretched self 
Long mayst thou live to wail thy childrens loss 
And see another  as I see thee now 
Deckd in thy rights  as thou art stalld in mine 
Long die thy happy days before thy death 
And  after many lengthend hours of grief 
Die neither mother  wife  nor Englands queen 
Rivers  and Dorset  you were standers by 
And so wast thou  Lord Hastings when my son 
Was stabbd with bloody daggers  God  I pray him 
That none of you may live your natural age 
But by some unlookd accident cut off 

Have done thy charm  thou hateful witherd hag 

And leave out thee  stay  dog  for thou shalt hear me 
If heaven have any grievous plague in store 
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee 
O  let them keep it till thy sins be ripe 
And then hurl down their indignation 
On thee  the troubler of the poor worlds peace 
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul 
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livst 
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends 
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine 
Unless it be while some tormenting dream 
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils 
Thou elvishmarkd  abortive  rooting hog 
Thou that wast seald in thy nativity 
The slave of nature and the son of hell 
Thou slander of thy mothers heavy womb 
Thou loathed issue of thy fathers loins 
Thou rag of honour  thou detested 

Margaret 

Richard 

Ha 

I call thee not 

I cry thee mercy then  for I did think 
That thou hadst calld me all these bitter names 

Why  so I did  but lookd for no reply 
O  let me make the period to my curse 

Tis done by me  and ends in Margaret  

Thus have you breathd your curso against yourself 

Poor painted queen  vain flourish of my fortune 
Why strewst thou sugar on that bottled spider 
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about 
Fool  fool  thou whetst a knife to kill thyself 
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me 
To help thee curse this poisnous bunchbackd toad 

Falseboding woman  end thy frantic curse 
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience 

Foul shame upon you  you have all movd mine 

Were you well servd  you would be taught your duty 

To serve me well  you all should do me duty 
Teach me to be your queen  and you my subjects 
O  serve me well  and teach yourselves that duty 

Dispute not with her  she is lunatic 

Peace  Master marquess  you are malapert 
Your firenew stamp of honour is scarce current 
O  that your young nobility could judge 
What twere to lose it  and be miserable 
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them 
And if they fall  they dash themselves to pieces 

Good counsel  marry  learn it  learn it  marquess 

It touches you  my lord  as much as me 

Ay  and much more  but I was born so high 
Our aery buildeth in the cedars top 
And dallies with the wind  and scorns the sun 

And turns the sun to shade  alas  alas 
Witness my son  now in the shade of death 
Whose bright outshining beams thy cloudy wrath 
Hath in eternal darkness folded up 
Your aery buildeth in our aerys nest 
O God  that seest it  do not suffer it 
As it was won with blood  lost be it so 

Peace  peace  for shame  if not for charity 

Urge neither charity nor shame to me 
Uncharitably with me have you dealt 
And shamefully my hopes by you are butcherd 
My charity is outrage  life my shame 
And in that shame still live my sorrows rage 

Have done  have done 

O princely Buckingham  Ill kiss thy hand 
In sign of league and amity with thee 
Now fair befall thee and thy noble house 
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood 
Nor thou within the compass of my curse 

Nor no one here  for curses never pass 
The lips of those that breathe them in the air 

I will not think but they ascend the sky 
And there awake Gods gentlesleeping peace 
O Buckingham  take heed of yonder dog 
Look  when he fawns  he bites  and when he bites 
His venom tooth will rankle to the death 
Have not to do with him  beware of him 
Sin  death and hell have set their marks on him 
And all their ministers attend on him 

What doth she say  my Lord of Buckingham 

Nothing that I respect  my gracious lord 

What  dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel 
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from 
O  but remember this another day 
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow 
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess 
Live each of you the subject to his hate 
And he to yours  and all of you to Gods 


My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses 

And so doth mine  I muse why shes at liberty 

I cannot blame her  by Gods holy mother 
She hath had too much wrong  and I repent 
My part thereof that I have done to her 

I never did her any  to my knowledge 

Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong 
I was too hot to do somebody good 
That is too cold in thinking of it now 
Marry  as for Clarence  he is well repaid 
He is frankd up to fatting for his pains 
God pardon them that are the cause thereof 

A virtuous and a Christianlike conclusion 
To pray for them that have done scath to us 

So do I ever 

being welladvisd 
For had I cursd now  I had cursd myself 


Madam  his majesty doth call for you 
And for your Grace  and you  my noble lords 

Catesby  I come  Lords  will you go with me 

We wait upon your Grace 


I do the wrong  and first begin to brawl 
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach 
I lay unto the grievous charge of others 
Clarence  whom I  indeed  have cast in darkness 
I do beweep to many simple gulls 
Namely  to Stanley  Hastings  Buckingham 
And tell them tis the queen and her allies 
That stir the king against the duke my brother 
Now they believe it  and withal whet me 
To be revengd on Rivers  Vaughan  Grey 
But then I sigh  and  with a piece of scripture 
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil 
And thus I clothe my naked villany 
With odd old ends stoln forth of holy writ 
And seem a saint when most I play the devil 


But soft  here come my executioners 
How now  my hardy  stout resolved mates 

Are you now going to dispatch this thing 

We are  my lord  and come to have the warrant 
That we may be admitted where he is 

Well thought upon  I have it here about me 

When you have done  repair to Crosbyplace 
But  sirs  be sudden in the execution 
Withal obdurate  do not hear him plead 
For Clarence is wellspoken  and perhaps 
May move your hearts to pity  if you mark him 

Tut  tut  my lord  we will not stand to prate 
Talkers are no good doers  be assurd 
We go to use our hands and not our tongues 

Your eyes drop millstones  when fools eyes fall tears 
I like you  lads  about your business straight 
Go  go  dispatch 

We will  my noble lord 


Why looks your Grace so heavily today 

O  I have passd a miserable night 
So full of ugly sights  of ghastly dreams 
That  as I am a Christian faithful man 
I would not spend another such a night 
Though twere to buy a world of happy days 
So full of dismal terror was the time 

What was your dream  my lord  I pray you  tell me 

Methought that I had broken from the Tower 
And was embarkd to cross to Burgundy 
And in my company my brother Gloucester 
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk 
Upon the hatches  thence we lookd toward England 
And cited up a thousand heavy times 
During the wars of York and Lancaster 
That had befalln us  As we pacd along 
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches 
Methought that Gloucester stumbled  and  in falling 
Struck me  that thought to stay him  overboard 
Into the tumbling billows of the main 
Lord  Lord  methought what pain it was to drown 
What dreadful noise of water in mine ears 
What sights of ugly death within mine eyes 
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wracks 
A thousand men that fishes gnawd upon 
Wedges of gold  great anchors  heaps of pearl 
Inestimable stones  unvalud jewels 
All scatterd in the bottom of the sea 
Some lay in dead mens skulls  and in those holes 
Where eyes did once inhabit  there were crept 
As twere in scorn of eyes  reflecting gems 
That wood the slimy bottom of the deep 
And mockd the dead bones that lay scatterd by 

Had you such leisure in the time of death 
To gaze upon those secrets of the deep 

Methought I had  and often did I strive 
To yield the ghost  but still the envious flood 
Stopt in my soul  and would not let it forth 
To find the empty  vast  and wandering air 
But smotherd it within my panting bulk 
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea 

Awakd you not with this sore agony 

No  no  my dream was lengthend after life 
O  then began the tempest to my soul 
I passd  methought  the melancholy flood 
With that grim ferryman which poets write of 
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night 
The first that there did greet my stranger soul 
Was my great fatherinlaw  renowned Warwick 
Who cried aloud  What scourge for perjury 
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence  
And so he vanishd  then came wandering by 
A shadow like an angel  with bright hair 
Dabbled in blood  and he shriekd out aloud 
Clarence is come false  fleeting  perjurd Clarence 
That stabbd me in the field by Tewksbury 
Seize on him  Furies  take him unto torment  
With that  methought  a legion of foul fiends 
Environd me  and howled in mine ears 
Such hideous cries  that  with the very noise 
I trembling wakd  and  for a season after 
Could not believe but that I was in hell 
Such terrible impression made my dream 

No marvel  lord  though it affrighted you 
I am afraid  methinks  to hear you tell it 

O Brakenbury  I have done these things 
That now give evidence against my soul 
For Edwards sake  and see how he requites me 
O God  if my deep prayers cannot appease thee 
But thou wilt be avengd on my misdeeds 
Yet execute thy wrath on me alone 
O  spare my guiltless wife and my poor children 
I pray thee  gentle keeper  stay by me 
My soul is heavy  and I fain would sleep 

I will  my lord  God give your Grace good rest 

Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours 
Makes the night morning  and the noontide night 
Princes have but their titles for their glories 
An outward honour for an inward toil 
And  for unfelt imaginations 
They often feel a world of restless cares 
So that  between their titles and low names 
Theres nothing differs but the outward fame 


Ho  whos here 

What wouldst thou  fellow  and how camst thou hither 

I would speak with Clarence  and I came hither on my legs 

What  so brief 

Tis better  sir  than to be tedious 
Let him see our commission  and talk no more 


I am  in this  commanded to deliver 
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands 
I will not reason what is meant hereby 
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning 
There lies the duke asleep  and there the keys 
Ill to the king  and signify to him 
That thus I have resignd to you my charge 

You may  sir  tis a point of wisdom  fare you well 


What  shall we stab him as he sleeps 

No  hell say twas done cowardly  when he wakes 

When he wakes  why  fool  he shall never wake till the judgmentday 

Why  then hell say we stabbed him sleeping 

The urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in me 

What  art thou afraid 

Not to kill him  having a warrant for it  but to be damnd for killing him  from the which no warrant can defend me 

I thought thou hadst been resolute 

So I am  to let him live 

Ill back to the Duke of Gloucester  and tell him so 

Nay  I prithee  stay a little  I hope my holy humour will change  it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty 

How dost thou feel thyself now 

Some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me 

Remember our reward when the deeds done 

Zounds  he dies  I had forgot the reward 

Wheres thy conscience now 

In the Duke of Gloucesters purse 

So when he opens his purse to give us our reward  thy conscience flies out 

Tis no matter  let it go  theres few or none will entertain it 

What if it come to thee again 

Ill not meddle with it  it makes a man a coward  a man cannot steal  but it accuseth him  a man cannot swear  but it checks him  a man cannot lie with his neighbours wife  but it detects him  tis a blushing shamefast spirit  that mutinies in a mans bosom  it fills one full of obstacles  it made me once restore a purse of gold that I found  it beggars any man that keeps it  it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing  and every man that means to live well  endeavours to trust to himself and live without it 

Zounds  it is even now at my elbow  persuading me not to kill the duke 

Take the devil in thy mind  and believe him not  he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh 

Tut  I am strongframed  he cannot prevail with me 

Spoke like a tall fellow that respects his reputation  Come  shall we to this gear 

Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy sword  and then throw him into the malmseybutt in the next room 

O  excellent device  make a sop of him 

Soft  he wakes 

Strike 

No  well reason with him 

Where art thou  keeper  give me a cup of wine 

You shall have wine enough  my lord  anon 

In Gods name  what art thou 

A man  as you are 

But not  as I am  royal 

Nor you  as we are  loyal 

Thy voice is thunder  but thy looks are humble 

My voice is now the kings  my looks mine own 

How darkly  and how deadly dost thou speak 
Your eyes do menace me  why look you pale 
Who sent you hither  Wherefore do you come 

To  to  to 

To murder me 

Ay  ay 

You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so 
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it 
Wherein  my friends  have I offended you 

Offended us you have not  but the king 

I shall be reconcild to him again 

Never  my lord  therefore prepare to die 

Are you calld forth from out a world of men 
To slay the innocent  What is my offence 
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me 
What lawful quest have given their verdict up 
Unto the frowning judge  or who pronouncd 
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence death 
Before I be convict by course of law 
To threaten me with death is most unlawful 
I charge you  as you hope to have redemption 
By Christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins 
That you depart and lay no hands on me 
The deed you undertake is damnable 

What we will do  we do upon command 

And he that hath commanded is our king 

Erroneous vassal  the great King of kings 
Hath in the table of his law commanded 
That thou shalt do no murder  will you  then 
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans 
Take heed  for he holds vengeance in his hand 
To hurl upon their heads that break his law 

And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee 
For false forswearing and for murder too 
Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight 
In quarrel of the house of Lancaster 

And  like a traitor to the name of God 
Didst break that vow  and  with thy treacherous blade 
Unrippdst the bowels of thy sovereigns son 

Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend 

How canst thou urge Gods dreadful law to us 
When thou hast broke it in such dear degree 

Alas  for whose sake did I that ill deed 
For Edward  for my brother  for his sake 
He sends you not to murder me for this 
For in that sin he is as deep as I 
If God will be avenged for the deed 
O  know you yet  he doth it publicly 
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm 
He needs no indirect or lawless course 
To cut off those that have offended him 

Who made thee then a bloody minister 
When gallantspringing  brave Plantagenet 
That princely novice  was struck dead by thee 

My brothers love  the devil  and my rage 

Thy brothers love  our duty  and thy fault 
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee 

If you do love my brother  hate not me 
I am his brother  and I love him well 
If you are hird for meed  go back again 
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester 
Who shall reward you better for my life 
Than Edward will for tidings of my death 

You are deceivd  your brother Gloucester hates you 

O  no  he loves me  and he holds me dear 
Go you to him from me 

Ay  so we will 

Tell him  when that our princely father York 
Blessd his three sons with his victorious arm 
And chargd us from his soul to love each other 
He little thought of this divided friendship 
Bid Gloucester think on this  and he will weep 

Ay  millstones  as he lessond us to weep 

O  do not slander him  for he is kind 

Right 
As snow in harvest  Thou deceivst thyself 
Tis he that sends us to destroy you here 

It cannot be  for he bewept my fortune 
And huggd me in his arms  and swore  with sobs 
That he would labour my delivery 

Why  so he doth  when he delivers you 
From this earths thraldom to the joys of heaven 

Make peace with God  for you must die  my lord 

Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul 
To counsel me to make my peace with God 
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind 
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me 
O  sirs  consider  he that set you on 
To do this deed  will hate you for the deed 

What shall we do 

Relent and save your souls 

Relent  tis cowardly  and womanish 

Not to relent  is beastly  savage  devilish 
Which of you  if you were a princes son 
Being pent from liberty  as I am now 
If two such murdrers as yourselves came to you 
Would not entreat for life 
My friend  I spy some pity in thy looks 
O  if thine eye be not a flatterer 
Come thou on my side  and entreat for me 
As you would beg  were you in my distress 
A begging prince what beggar pities not 

Look behind you  my lord 

Take that  and that  if all this will not do 
Ill drown you in the malmseybutt within 


A bloody deed  and desperately dispatchd 
How fain  like Pilate  would I wash my hands 
Of this most grievous murder 


How now  what meanst thou  that thou helpst me not 
By heaven  the duke shall know how slack you have been 

I would he knew that I had savd his brother 
Take thou the fee  and tell him what I say 
For I repent me that the duke is slain 


So do not I  go  coward as thou art 
Well  Ill go hide the body in some hole 
Till that the duke give order for his burial 
And when I have my meed  I will away 
For this will out  and here I must not stay 

Why  so  now have I done a good days work 
You peers  continue this united league 
I every day expect an embassage 
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence 
And more in peace my soul shall part to heaven 
Since I have made my friends at peace on earth 
Rivers and Hastings  take each others hand 
Dissemble not your hatred  swear your love 

By heaven  my soul is purgd from grudging hate 
And with my hand I seal my true hearts love 

So thrive I  as I truly swear the like 

Take heed  you dally not before your king 
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings 
Confound your hidden falsehood  and award 
Either of you to be the others end 

So prosper I  as I swear perfect love 

And I  as I love Hastings with my heart 

Madam  yourself are not exempt in this 
Nor you  son Dorset  Buckingham  nor you 
You have been factious one against the other 
Wife  love Lord Hastings  let him kiss your hand 
And what you do  do it unfeignedly 

There  Hastings  I will never more remember 
Our former hatred  so thrive I and mine 

Dorset  embrace him  Hastings  love lord marquess 

This interchange of love  I here protest 
Upon my part shall be inviolable 

And so swear I 


Now  princely Buckingham  seal thou this league 
With thy embracements to my wifes allies 
And make me happy in your unity 

Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate 
Upon your Grace  but with all duteous love 
Doth cherish you and yours  God punish me 
With hate in those where I expect most love 
When I have most need to employ a friend 
And most assured that he is a friend 
Deep  hollow  treacherous  and full of guile 
Be he unto me  This do I beg of God 
When I am cold in love to you or yours 


A pleasing cordial  princely Buckingham 
Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart 
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here 
To make the blessed period of this peace 

And  in good time  here comes the noble duke 


Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen 
And princely peers  a happy time of day 

Happy  indeed  as we have spent the day 
Gloucester  we have done deeds of charity 
Made peace of enmity  fair love of hate 
Between these swelling wrongincensed peers 

A blessed labour  my most sovereign lord 
Among this princely heap  if any here 
By false intelligence  or wrong surmise 
Hold me a foe 
If I unwittingly  or in my rage 
Have aught committed that is hardly borne 
By any in this presence  I desire 
To reconcile me to his friendly peace 
Tis death to me to be at enmity 
I hate it  and desire all good mens love 
First  madam  I entreat true peace of you 
Which I will purchase with my duteous service 
Of you  my noble cousin Buckingham 
If ever any grudge were lodgd between us 
Of you  Lord Rivers  and Lord Grey  of you 
That all without desert have frownd on me 
Of you  Lord Woodvile  and Lord Scales  of you 
Dukes  earls  lords  gentlemen  indeed  of all 
I do not know that Englishman alive 
With whom my soul is any jot at odds 
More than the infant that is born tonight 
I thank my God for my humility 

A holy day shall this be kept hereafter 
I would to God all strifes were well compounded 
My sovreign lord  I do beseech your highness 
To take our brother Clarence to your grace 

Why  madam  have I offerd love for this 
To be so flouted in this royal presence 
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead 

You do him injury to scorn his corse 

Who knows not he is dead  who knows he is 

Allseeing heaven  what a world is this 

Look I so pale  Lord Dorset  as the rest 

Ay  my good lord  and no man in the presence 
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks 

Is Clarence dead  the order was reversd 

But he  poor man  by your first order died 
And that a winged Mercury did bear 
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand 
That came too lag to see him buried 
God grant that some  less noble and less loyal 
Nearer in bloody thoughts  and not in blood 
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did 
And yet go current from suspicion 


A boon  my sovreign  for my service done 

I prithee  peace  my soul is full of sorrow 

I will not rise  unless your highness hear me 

Then say at once  what is it thou requestst 

The forfeit  sovereign  of my servants life 
Who slew today a riotous gentleman 
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk 

Have I a tongue to doom my brothers death 
And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave 
My brother killd no man  his fault was thought 
And yet his punishment was bitter death 
Who sud to me for him  who  in my wrath 
Kneeld at my feet  and bade me be advisd 
Who spoke of brotherhood  who spoke of love 
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake 
The mighty Warwick  and did fight for me 
Who told me  in the field at Tewksbury 
When Oxford had me down  he rescud me 
And said  Dear brother  live  and be a king  
Who told me  when we both lay in the field 
Frozen almost to death  how he did lap me 
Even in his garments  and did give himself 
All thin and naked  to the numb cold night 
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath 
Sinfully pluckd  and not a man of you 
Had so much grace to put it in my mind 
But when your carters or your waitingvassals 
Have done a drunken slaughter  and defacd 
The precious image of our dear Redeemer 
You straight are on your knees for pardon  pardon 
And I  unjustly too  must grant it you 
But for my brother not a man would speak 
Nor I  ungracious  speak unto myself 
For him  poor soul  The proudest of you all 
Have been beholding to him in his life 
Yet none of you would once beg for his life 
O God  I fear  thy justice will take hold 
On me and you and mine and yours for this 
Come  Hastings  help me to my closet  O  poor Clarence 


This is the fruit of rashness  Markd you not 
How that the guilty kindred of the queen 
Lookd pale when they did hear of Clarence death 
O  they did urge it still unto the king 
God will revenge it  Come  lords  will you go 
To comfort Edward with our company 

We wait upon your Grace 


Good grandam  tell us  is our father dead 

No  boy 

Why do you wring your hands  and beat your breast 
And cry O Clarence  my unhappy son  

Why do you look on us  and shake your head 
And call us orphans  wretches  castaways 
If that our noble father be alive 

My pretty cousins  you mistake me much 
I do lament the sickness of the king 
As loath to lose him  not your fathers death 
It were lost sorrow to wail one thats lost 

Then  grandam  you conclude that he is dead 
The king mine uncle is to blame for it 
God will revenge it  whom I will importune 
With earnest prayers all to that effect 

And so will I 

Peace  children  peace  the king doth love you well 
Incapable and shallow innocents 
You cannot guess who causd your fathers death 

Grandam  we can  for my good uncle Gloucester 
Told me  the king  provokd tot by the queen 
Devisd impeachments to imprison him 
And when my uncle told me so  he wept 
And pitied me  and kindly kissd my cheek 
Bade me rely on him  as on my father 
And he would love me dearly as his child 

Ah  that deceit should steal such gentle shape 
And with a virtuous vizard hide deep vice 
He is my son  ay  and therein my shame 
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit 

Think you my uncle did dissemble  grandam 

Ay  boy 

I cannot think it  Hark  what noise is this 


Oh  who shall hinder me to wail and weep 
To chide my fortune  and torment myself 
Ill join with black despair against my soul 
And to myself become an enemy 

What means this scene of rude impatience 

To make an act of tragic violence 
Edward  my lord  thy son  our king  is dead 
Why grow the branches now the root is witherd 
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap 
If you will live  lament  if die  be brief 
That our swiftwinged souls may catch the kings 
Or  like obedient subjects  follow him 
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest 

Ah  so much interest have I in thy sorrow 
As I had title in thy noble husband 
I have bewept a worthy husbands death 
And livd with looking on his images 
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance 
Are crackd in pieces by malignant death 
And I for comfort have but one false glass 
That grieves me when I see my shame in him 
Thou art a widow  yet thou art a mother 
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee 
But death hath snatchd my husband from mine arms 
And pluckd two crutches from my feeble limbs 
Clarence and Edward  O  what cause have I 
Thine being but a moiety of my grief 
To overgo thy plaints  and drown thy cries 

Ah  aunt  you wept not for our fathers death 
How can we aid you with our kindred tears 

Our fatherless distress was left unmoand 
Your widowdolour likewise be unwept 

Give me no help in lamentation 
I am not barren to bring forth complaints 
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes 
That I  being governd by the watry moon 
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world 
Ah  for my husband  for my dear Lord Edward 

Ah  for our father  for our dear Lord Clarence 

Alas  for both  both mine  Edward and Clarence 

What stay had I but Edward  and hes gone 

What stay had we but Clarence  and hes gone 

What stays had I but they  and they are gone 

Was never widow had so dear a loss 

Were never orphans had so dear a loss 

Was never mother had so dear a loss 
Alas  I am the mother of these griefs 
Their woes are parcelld  mine are general 
She for an Edward weeps  and so do I 
I for a Clarence weep  so doth not she 
These babes for Clarence weep  and so do I 
I for an Edward weep  so do not they 
Alas  you three  on me  threefold distressd 
Pour all your tears  I am your sorrows nurse 
And I will pamper it with lamentation 

Comfort  dear mother  God is much displeasd 
That you take with unthankfulness his doing 
In common worldly things tis calld ungrateful 
With dull unwillingness to repay a debt 
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent 
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven 
For it requires the royal debt it lent you 

Madam  bethink you  like a careful mother 
Of the young prince your son  send straight for him 
Let him be crownd  in him your comfort lives 
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edwards grave 
And plant your joys in living Edwards throne 


Sister  have comfort  all of us have cause 
To wail the dimming of our shining star 
But none can cure their harms by wailing them 
Madam  my mother  I do cry you mercy 
I did not see your Grace  humbly on my knee 
I crave your blessing 

God bless thee  and put meekness in thy mind 
Love  charity  obedience  and true duty 

Amen 

and make me die a good old man 
That is the buttend of a mothers blessing 
I marvel that her Grace did leave it out 

You cloudy princes and heartsorrowing peers 
That bear this heavy mutual load of moan 
Now cheer each other in each others love 
Though we have spent our harvest of this king 
We are to reap the harvest of his son 
The broken rancour of your highswoln hearts 
But lately splinterd  knit  and joind together 
Must gently be preservd  cherishd  and kept 
Me seemeth good  that  with some little train 
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetchd 
Hither to London  to be crownd our king 

Why with some little train  my Lord of Buckingham 

Marry  my lord  lest  by a multitude 
The newheald wound of malice should break out 
Which would be so much the more dangerous 
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovernd 
Where every horse bears his commanding rein 
And may direct his course as please himself 
As well the fear of harm  as harm apparent 
In my opinion  ought to be prevented 

I hope the king made peace with all of us 
And the compact is firm and true in me 

And so in me  and so  I think  in all 
Yet  since it is but green  it should be put 
To no apparent likelihood of breach 
Which haply by much company might be urgd 
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham 
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince 

And so say I 

Then be it so  and go we to determine 
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow 
Madam  and you my mother  will you go 
To give your censures in this business 


My lord  whoever journeys to the prince 
For Gods sake  let not us two stay at home 
For by the way Ill sort occasion 
As index to the story we late talkd of 
To part the queens proud kindred from the prince 

My other self  my counsels consistory 
My oracle  my prophet  My dear cousin 
I  as a child  will go by thy direction 
Towards Ludlow then  for well not stay behind 


Good morrow  neighbour  whither away so fast 

I promise you  I scarcely know myself 
Hear you the news abroad 

Ay  that the king is dead 

Ill news  byr lady  seldom comes the better 
I fear  I fear  twill prove a giddy world 


Neighbours  God speed 

Give you good morrow  sir 

Doth the news hold of good King Edwards death 

Ay  sir  it is too true  God help the while 

Then  masters  look to see a troublous world 

No  no  by Gods good grace  his son shall reign 

Woe to that land thats governd by a child 

In him there is a hope of government 
That in his nonage council under him 
And in his full and ripend years himself 
No doubt  shall then and till then govern well 

So stood the state when Henry the Sixth 
Was crownd at Paris but at nine months old 

Stood the state so  no  no  good friends  God wot 
For then this land was famously enrichd 
With politic grave counsel  then the king 
Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace 

Why  so hath this  both by his father and mother 

Better it were they all came by his father 
Or by his father there were none at all 
For emulation  who shall now be nearest 
Will touch us all too near  if God prevent not 
O  full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester 
And the queens sons and brothers haught and proud 
And were they to be ruld  and not to rule 
This sickly land might solace as before 

Come  come  we fear the worst  all will be well 

When clouds are seen  wise men put on their cloaks 
When great leaves fall  then winter is at hand 
When the sun sets  who doth not look for night 
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth 
All may be well  but  if God sort it so 
Tis more than we deserve  or I expect 

Truly  the hearts of men are full of fear 
You cannot reason almost with a man 
That looks not heavily and full of dread 

Before the days of change  still is it so 
By a divine instinct mens minds mistrust 
Ensuing danger  as  by proof  we see 
The waters swell before a boisterous storm 
But leave it all to God  Whither away 

Marry  we were sent for to the justices 

And so was I  Ill bear you company 


Last night  I hear  they lay at Northampton 
At StonyStratford they do rest tonight 
Tomorrow  or next day  they will be here 

I long with all my heart to see the prince 
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him 

But I hear  no  they say my son of York 
Hath almost overtaen him in his growth 

Ay  mother  but I would not have it so 

Why  my young cousin  it is good to grow 

Grandam  one night  as we did sit at supper 
My uncle Rivers talkd how I did grow 
More than my brother  Ay  quoth my uncle Gloucester 
Small herbs have grace  great weeds do grow apace  
And since  methinks  I would not grow so fast 
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste 

Good faith  good faith  the saying did not hold 
In him that did object the same to thee 
He was the wretchedst thing when he was young 
So long agrowing  and so leisurely 
That  if his rule were true  he should be gracious 

And so  no doubt  he is  my gracious madam 

I hope he is  but yet let mothers doubt 

Now  by my troth  if I had been rememberd 
I could have given my uncles grace a flout 
To touch his growth nearer than he touchd mine 

How  my young York  I prithee  let me hear it 

Marry  they say my uncle grew so fast 
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old 
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth 
Grandam  this would have been a biting jest 

I prithee  pretty York  who told thee this 

Grandam  his nurse 

His nurse  why  she was dead ere thou wast born 

If twere not she  I cannot tell who told me 

A parlous boy  go to  you are too shrewd 

Good madam  be not angry with the child 

Pitchers have ears 


Here comes a messenger  What news 

Such news  my lord  as grieves me to report 

How doth the prince 

Well  madam  and in health 

What is thy news 

Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret 
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan  prisoners 

Who hath committed them 

The mighty dukes 
Gloucester and Buckingham 

For what offence 

The sum of all I can I have disclosd 
Why or for what the nobles were committed 
Is all unknown to me  my gracious lord 

Ah me  I see the ruin of my house 
The tiger now hath seizd the gentle hind 
Insulting tyranny begins to jet 
Upon the innocent and aweless throne 
Welcome  destruction  death  and massacre 
I see  as in a map  the end of all 

Accursed and unquiet wrangling days 
How many of you have mine eyes beheld 
My husband lost his life to get the crown 
And often up and down my sons were tossd 
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss 
And being seated  and domestic broils 
Clean overblown  themselves  the conquerors 
Make war upon themselves  brother to brother 
Blood to blood  self against self  O  preposterous 
And frantic outrage  end thy damned spleen 
Or let me die  to look on death no more 

Come  come  my boy  we will to sanctuary 
Madam  farewell 

Stay  I will go with you 

You have no cause 

My gracious lady  go 
And thither bear your treasure and your goods 
For my part  Ill resign unto your Grace 
The seal I keep  and so betide to me 
As well I tender you and all of yours 
Come  Ill conduct you to the sanctuary 


Welcome  sweet prince  to London  to your chamber 

Welcome  dear cousin  my thoughts sovereign 
The weary way hath made you melancholy 

No  uncle  but our crosses on the way 
Have made it tedious  wearisome  and heavy 
I want more uncles here to welcome me 

Sweet prince  the untainted virtue of your years 
Hath not yet divd into the worlds deceit 
No more can you distinguish of a man 
Than of his outward show  which  God he knows 
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart 
Those uncles which you want were dangerous 
Your Grace attended to their sugard words 
But lookd not on the poison of their hearts 
God keep you from them  and from such false friends 

God keep me from false friends  but they were none 

My lord  the Mayor of London comes to greet you 


God bless your Grace with health and happy days 

I thank you  good my lord  and thank you all 
I thought my mother and my brother York 
Would long ere this have met us on the way 
Fie  what a slug is Hastings  that he comes not 
To tell us whether they will come or no 


And in good time here comes the sweating lord 

Welcome  my lord  What  will our mother come 

On what occasion  God he knows  not I 
The queen your mother  and your brother York 
Have taken sanctuary  the tender prince 
Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace 
But by his mother was perforce withheld 

Fie  what an indirect and peevish course 
Is this of hers  Lord Cardinal  will your Grace 
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York 
Unto his princely brother presently 
If she deny  Lord Hastings  go with him 
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce 

My Lord of Buckingham  if my weak oratory 
Can from his mother win the Duke of York 
Anon expect him here  but if she be obdurate 
To mild entreaties  God in heaven forbid 
We should infringe the holy privilege 
Of blessed sanctuary  not for all this land 
Would I be guilty of so great a sin 

You are too senselessobstinate  my lord 
Too ceremonious and traditional 
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age 
You break not sanctuary in seizing him 
The benefit thereof is always granted 
To those whose dealings have deservd the place 
And those who have the wit to claim the place 
This prince hath neither claimd it  nor deservd it 
And therefore  in mine opinion  cannot have it 
Then  taking him from thence that is not there 
You break no privilege nor charter there 
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men 
But sanctuary children neer till now 

My lord  you shall oerrule my mind for once 
Come on  Lord Hastings  will you go with me 

I go  my lord 

Good lords  make all the speedy haste you may 

Say  uncle Gloucester  if our brother come 
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation 

Where it seems best unto your royal self 
If I may counsel you  some day or two 
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower 
Then where you please  and shall be thought most fit 
For your best health and recreation 

I do not like the Tower  of any place 
Did Julius C sar build that place  my lord 

He did  my gracious lord  begin that place 
Which  since  succeeding ages have reedified 

Is it upon record  or else reported 
Successively from age to age  he built it 

Upon record  my gracious lord 

But say  my lord  it were not registerd 
Methinks the truth should live from age to age 
As twere retaild to all posterity 
Even to the general allending day 

So wise so young  they say  do never live long 

What say you  uncle 

I say  without characters  fame lives long 


Thus  like the formal Vice  Iniquity 
I moralize two meanings in one word 

That Julius C sar was a famous man 
With what his valour did enrich his wit 
His wit set down to make his valour live 
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror 
For now he lives in fame  though not in life 
Ill tell you what  my cousin Buckingham 

What  my gracious lord 

An if I live until I be a man 
Ill win our ancient right in France again 
Or die a soldier  as I livd a king 

Short summers lightly have a forward spring 


Now  in good time  here comes the Duke of York 

Richard of York  how fares our loving brother 

Well  my dread lord  so must I call you now 

Ay  brother  to our grief  as it is yours 
Too late he died that might have kept that title 
Which by his death hath lost much majesty 

How fares our cousin  noble Lord of York 

I thank you  gentle uncle  O  my lord 
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth 
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far 

He hath  my lord 

And therefore is he idle 

O  my fair cousin  I must not say so 

Then he is more beholding to you than I 

He may command me as my sovereign 
But you have power in me as in a kinsman 

I pray you  uncle  give me this dagger 

My dagger  little cousin  with all my heart 

A beggar  brother 

Of my kind uncle  that I know will give 
And  being but a toy  which is no grief to give 

A greater gift than that Ill give my cousin 

A greater gift  O  thats the sword to it 

Ay  gentle cousin  were it light enough 

O  then  I see  youll part but with light gifts 
In weightier things youll say a beggar nay 

It is too weighty for your Grace to wear 

I weigh it lightly  were it heavier 

What  would you have my weapon  little lord 

I would  that I might thank you  as you call me 

How 

Little 

My Lord of York will still be cross in talk 
Uncle  your Grace knows how to bear with him 

You mean  to bear me  not to bear with me 
Uncle  my brother mocks both you and me 
Because that I am little  like an ape 
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders 

With what a sharp provided with he reasons 
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle 
He prettily and aptly taunts himself 
So cunning and so young is wonderful 

My lord  willt please you pass along 
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham 
Will to your mother  to entreat of her 
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you 

What  will you go unto the Tower  my lord 

My Lord Protector needs will have it so 

I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower 

Why  what would you fear 

Marry  my uncle Clarence angry ghost 
My grandam told me he was murderd there 

I fear no uncles dead 

Nor none that live  I hope 

An if they live  I hope  I need not fear 
But come  my lord  and  with a heavy heart 
Thinking on them  go I unto the Tower 


Think you  my lord  this little prating York 
Was not incensed by his subtle mother 
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously 

No doubt  no doubt  O  tis a parlous boy 
Bold  quick  ingenious  forward  capable 
Hes all the mothers  from the top to toe 

Well  let them rest  Come hither  Catesby  thou art sworn 
As deeply to effect what we intend 
As closely to conceal what we impart 
Thou knowst our reasons urgd upon the way 
What thinkst thou  is it not an easy matter 
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind 
For the instalment of this noble duke 
In the seat royal of this famous isle 

He for his fathers sake so loves the prince 
That he will not be won to aught against him 

What thinkst thou then of Stanley  what will he 

He will do all in all as Hastings doth 

Well then  no more but this  go  gentle Catesby 
And  as it were far off  sound thou Lord Hastings 
How he doth stand affected to our purpose 
And summon him tomorrow to the Tower 
To sit about the coronation 
If thou dost find him tractable to us 
Encourage him  and tell him all our reasons 
If he be leaden  icycold  unwilling 
Be thou so too  and so break off the talk 
And give us notice of his inclination 
For we tomorrow hold divided councils 
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employd 

Commend me to Lord William  tell him  Catesby 
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries 
Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle 
And bid my lord  for joy of this good news 
Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more 

Good Catesby  go  effect this business soundly 

My good lords both  with all the heed I can 

Shall we hear from you  Catesby  ere we sleep 

You shall  my lord 

At Crosbyplace  there shall you find us both 


Now  my lord  what shall we do if we perceive 
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots 

Chop off his head  something we will determine 
And  look  when I am king  claim thou of me 
The earldom of Hereford  and all the moveables 
Whereof the king my brother stood possessd 

Ill claim that promise at your Graces hand 

And look to have it yielded with all kindness 
Come  let us sup betimes  that afterwards 
We may digest our complots in some form 


My lord  my lord 

Who knocks 

One from the Lord Stanley 

What ist oclock 

Upon the stroke of four 


Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights 

So it appears by that I have to say 
First  he commends him to your noble self 

What then 

Then certifies your lordship  that this night 
He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm 
Besides  he says there are two councils held 
And that may be determind at the one 
Which may make you and him to rue at the other 
Therefore he sends to know your lordships pleasure 
If you will presently take horse with him 
And with all speed post with him towards the north 
To shun the danger that his soul divines 

Go  fellow  go  return unto thy lord 
Bid him not fear the separated councils 
His honour and myself are at the one 
And at the other is my good friend Catesby 
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us 
Whereof I shall not have intelligence 
Tell him his fears are shallow  wanting instance 
And for his dreams  I wonder hes so fond 
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers 
To fly the boar before the boar pursues 
Were to incense the boar to follow us 
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase 
Go  bid thy master rise and come to me 
And we will both together to the Tower 
Where  he shall see  the boar will use us kindly 

Ill go  my lord  and tell him what you say 

Many good morrows to my noble lord 

Good morrow  Catesby  you are early stirring 
What news  what news  in this our tottering state 

It is a reeling world  indeed  my lord 
And I believe will never stand upright 
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm 

How  wear the garland  dost thou mean the crown 

Ay  my good lord 

Ill have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders 
Before Ill see the crown so foul misplacd 
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it 

Ay  on my life  and hopes to find you forward 
Upon his party for the gain thereof 
And thereupon he sends you this good news 
That this same very day your enemies 
The kindred of the queen  must die at Pomfret 

Indeed  I am no mourner for that news 
Because they have been still my adversaries 
But that Ill give my voice on Richards side 
To bar my masters heirs in true descent 
God knows I will not do it  to the death 

God keep your lordship in that gracious mind 

But I shall laugh at this a twelvemonth hence 
That they which brought me in my masters hate 
I live to look upon their tragedy 
Well  Catesby  ere a fortnight make me older 
Ill send some packing that yet think not ont 

Tis a vile thing to die  my gracious lord 
When men are unprepard and look not for it 

O monstrous  monstrous  and so falls it out 
With Rivers  Vaughan  Grey  and so twill do 
With some men else  who think themselves as safe 
As thou and I  who  as thou knowst  are dear 
To princely Richard and to Buckingham 

The princes both make high account of you 


For they account his head upon the bridge 

I know they do  and I have well deservd it 


Come on  come on  where is your boarspear  man 

Fear you the boar  and go so unprovided 

My lord  good morrow  good morrow Catesby 
You may jest on  but by the holy rood 
I do not like these several councils  I 

My lord  I hold my life as dear as you do yours 
And never  in my days  I do protest 
Was it so precious to me as tis now 
Think you  but that I know our state secure 
I would be so triumphant as I am 

The lords at Pomfret  when they rode from London 
Were jocund and supposd their state was sure 
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust 
But yet you see how soon the day oercast 
This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt 
Pray God  I say  I prove a needless coward 
What  shall we toward the Tower  the day is spent 

Come  come  have with you  Wot you what  my lord 
Today the lords you talk of are beheaded 

They  for their truth  might better wear their heads 
Than some that have accusd them wear their hats 
But come  my lord  lets away 


Go on before  Ill talk with this good fellow 

How now  sirrah  how goes the world with thee 

The better that your lordship please to ask 

I tell thee  man  tis better with me now 
Than when I met thee last where now we meet 
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower 
By the suggestion of the queens allies 
But now  I tell thee keep it to thyself 
This day those enemies are put to death 
And I in better state than eer I was 

God hold it to your honours good content 

Gramercy  fellow  there  drink that for me 


God save your lordship 

Well met  my lord  I am glad to see your honour 

I thank thee  good Sir John  with all my heart 
I am in your debt for your last exercise 
Come the next Sabbath  and I will content you 


What  talking with a priest  lord chamberlain 
Your friends at Pomfret  they do need the priest 
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand 

Good faith  and when I met this holy man 
The men you talk of came into my mind 
What  go you toward the Tower 

I do  my lord  but long I shall not stay 
I shall return before your lordship thence 

Nay  like enough  for I stay dinner there 

And supper too  although thou knowst it not 
Come  will you go 

Ill wait upon your lordship 


Sir Richard Ratcliff  let me tell thee this 
Today shalt thou behold a subject die 
For truth  for duty  and for loyalty 

God bless the prince from all the pack of you 
A knot you are of damned blood suckers 

You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter 

Dispatch  the limit of your lives is out 

O Pomfret  Pomfret  O thou bloody prison 
Fatal and ominous to noble peers 
Within the guilty closure of thy walls 
Richard the Second here was hackd to death 
And  for more slander to thy dismal seat 
We give thee up our guitless blood to drink 

Now Margarets curse is falln upon our heads 
When she exclaimd on Hastings  you  and I 
For standing by when Richard stabbd her son 

Then cursd she Richard  then cursd she Buckingham 
Then cursd she Hastings  O  remember  God 
To hear her prayer for them  as now for us 
And for my sister and her princely sons 
Be satisfied  dear God  with our true blood 
Which  as thou knowst  unjustly must be spilt 

Make haste  the hour of death is expiate 

Come  Grey  come  Vaughan  let us here embrace 
And take our leave until we meet in heaven 

My lords  at once  the cause why we are met 
Is to determine of the coronation 
In Gods name  speak  when is the royal day 

Are all things ready for that royal time 

It is  and wants but nomination 

Tomorrow then I judge a happy day 

Who knows the Lord Protectors mind herein 
Who is most inward with the noble duke 

Your Grace  we think  should soonest know his mind 

We know each others faces  for our hearts 
He knows no more of mine than I of yours 
Nor I of his  my lord  than you of mine 
Lord Hastings  you and he are near in love 

I thank his Grace  I know he loves me well 
But  for his purpose in the coronation 
I have not sounded him  nor he deliverd 
His gracious pleasure any way therein 
But you  my noble lords  may name the time 
And in the dukes behalf Ill give my voice 
Which  I presume  hell take in gentle part 


In happy time  here comes the duke himself 

My noble lords and cousins all  good morrow 
I have been long a sleeper  but  I trust 
My absence doth neglect no great design 
Which by my presence might have been concluded 

Had you not come upon your cue  my lord 
William Lord Hastings had pronouncd your part 
I mean  your voice  for crowning of the king 

Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder 
His lordship knows me well  and loves me well 
My Lord of Ely  when I was last in Holborn 
I saw good strawberries in your garden there 
I do beseech you send for some of them 

Marry  and will  my lord  with all my heart 


Cousin of Buckingham  a word with you 

Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business 
And finds the testy gentleman so hot 
That he will lose his head ere give consent 
His masters child  as worshipfully he terms it 
Shall lose the royalty of Englands throne 

Withdraw yourself a while  Ill go with you 


We have not yet set down this day of triumph 
Tomorrow  in my judgment  is too sudden 
For I myself am not so well provided 
As else I would be  were the day prolongd 


Where is my lord  the Duke of Gloucester 
I have sent for these strawberries 

His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning 
Theres some conceit or other likes him well 
When that he bids good morrow with such spirit 
I think theres never a man in Christendom 
Can lesser hide his hate or love than he 
For by his face straight shall you know his heart 

What of his heart perceivd you in his face 
By any livelihood he showd today 

Marry  that with no man here he is offended 
For  were he  he had shown it in his looks 


I pray you all  tell me what they deserve 
That do conspire my death with devilish plots 
Of damned witchcraft  and that have prevaild 
Upon my body with their hellish charms 

The tender love I bear your Grace  my lord 
Makes me most forward in this princely presence 
To doom th offenders  whosoeer they be 
I say  my lord  they have deserved death 

Then be your eyes the witness of their evil 
Look how I am bewitchd  behold mine arm 
Is like a blasted sapling  witherd up 
And this is Edwards wife  that monstrous witch 
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore 
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me 

If they have done this thing  my noble lord 

If  thou protector of this damned strumpet 
Talkst thou to me of ifs  Thou art a traitor 
Off with his head  now  by Saint Paul  I swear 
I will not dine until I see the same 
Lovel and Ratcliff  look that it be done 
The rest  that love me  rise  and follow me 


Woe  woe  for England  not a whit for me 
For I  too fond  might have prevented this 
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm 
And I did scorn it  and disdaind to fly 
Three times today my footcloth horse did stumble 
And startled when he looked upon the Tower 
As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse 
O  now I need the priest that spake to me 
I now repent I told the pursuivant 
As too triumphing  how mine enemies 
Today at Pomfret bloodily were butcherd 
And I myself secure in grace and favour 
O Margaret  Margaret  now thy heavy curse 
Is lighted on poor Hastings wretched head 

Come  come  dispatch  the duke would be at dinner 
Make a short shrift  he longs to see your head 

O momentary grace of mortal man 
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God 
Who builds his hope in air of your good looks 
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast 
Ready with every nod to tumble down 
Into the fatal bowels of the deep 

Come  come  dispatch  tis bootless to exclaim 

O bloody Richard  miserable England 
I prophesy the fearfullst time to thee 
That ever wretched age hath lookd upon 
Come  lead me to the block  bear him my head 
They smile at me who shortly shall be dead 


Come  cousin  canst thou quake  and change thy colour 
Murder thy breath in middle of a word 
And then again begin  and stop again 
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror 

Tut  I can counterfeit the deep tragedian 
Speak and look back  and pry on every side 
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw 
Intending deep suspicion  ghastly looks 
Are at my service  like enforced smiles 
And both are ready in their offices 
At any time  to grace my stratagems 
But what  is Catesby gone 

He is  and  see  he brings the mayor along 


Lord Mayor 

Look to the drawbridge there 

Hark  a drum 

Catesby  oerlook the walls 

Lord Mayor  the reason we have sent 

Look back  defend thee  here are enemies 

God and our innocency defend and guard us 


Be patient  they are friends  Ratcliff and Lovel 

Here is the head of that ignoble traitor 
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings 

So dear I lovd the man  that I must weep 
I took him for the plainest harmless creature 
That breathd upon the earth a Christian 
Made him my book  wherein my soul recorded 
The history of all her secret thoughts 
So smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue 
That  his apparent open guilt omitted 
I mean his conversation with Shores wife 
He livd from all attainder of suspect 

Well  well  he was the covertst shelterd traitor 
That ever livd 
Would you imagine  or almost believe 
Weret not that by great preservation 
We live to tell it  that the subtle traitor 
This day had plotted  in the councilhouse 
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester 

Had he done so 

What  think you we are Turks or infidels 
Or that we would  against the form of law 
Proceed thus rashly in the villains death 
But that the extreme peril of the case 
The peace of England and our persons safety 
Enforcd us to this execution 

Now  fair befall you  he deservd his death 
And your good Graces both have well proceeded 
To warn false traitors from the like attempts 
I never lookd for better at his hands 
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore 

Yet had we not determind he should die 
Until your lordship came to see his end 
Which now the loving haste of these our friends 
Something against our meaning  hath prevented 
Because  my lord  we would have had you heard 
The traitor speak  and timorously confess 
The manner and the purpose of his treason 
That you might well have signified the same 
Unto the citizens  who haply may 
Misconster us in him  and wail his death 

But  my good lord  your Graces word shall serve 
As well as I had seen and heard him speak 
And do not doubt  right noble princes both 
But Ill acquaint our duteous citizens 
With all your just proceedings in this cause 

And to that end we wishd your lordship here 
To avoid the censures of the carping world 

But since you come too late of our intent 
Yet witness what you hear we did intend 
And so  my good Lord Mayor  we bid farewell 


Go  after  after  cousin Buckingham 
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post 
There  at your meetest vantage of the time 
Infer the bastardy of Edwards children 
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen 
Only for saying he would make his son 
Heir to the crown  meaning indeed his house 
Which by the sign thereof was termed so 
Moreover  urge his hateful luxury 
And bestial appetite in change of lust 
Which stretchd unto their servants  daughters  wives 
Even where his raging eye or savage heart 
Without control lusted to make a prey 
Nay  for a need  thus far come near my person 
Tell them  when that my mother went with child 
Of that insatiate Edward  noble York 
My princely father then had wars in France 
And  by true computation of the time 
Found that the issue was not his begot 
Which well appeared in his lineaments 
Being nothing like the noble duke my father 
Yet touch this sparingly  as twere far off 
Because  my lord  you know my mother lives 

Doubt not  my lord  Ill play the orator 
As if the golden fee for which I plead 
Were for myself  and so  my lord  adieu 

If you thrive well  bring them to Baynards Castle 
Where you shall find me well accompanied 
With reverend fathers and welllearned bishops 

I go  and towards three or four oclock 
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords 


Go  Lovel  with all speed to Doctor Shaw 


Go thou to Friar Penker  bid them both 
Meet me within this hour at Baynards Castle 

Now will I in  to take some privy order 
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight 
And to give notice that no manner person 
Have any time recourse unto the princes 


Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings 
Which in a set hand fairly is engrossd 
That it may be today read oer in Pauls 
And mark how well the sequel hangs together 
Eleven hours I have spent to write it over 
For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me 
The precedent was full as long adoing 
And yet within these five hours Hastings livd 
Untainted  unexamind  free  at liberty 
Heres a good world the while  Who is so gross 
That cannot see this palpable device 
Yet who so bold but says he sees it not 
Bad is the world  and all will come to naught 
When such ill dealing must be seen in thought 


How  now  how now  what say the citizens 

Now  by the holy mother of our Lord 
The citizens are mum  say not a word 

Touchd you the bastardy of Edwards children 

I did  with his contract with Lady Lucy 
And his contract by deputy in France 
The insatiate greediness of his desires 
And his enforcement of the city wives 
His tyranny for trifles  his own bastardy 
As being got  your father then in France 
And his resemblance  being not like the duke 
Withal I did infer your lineaments 
Being the right idea of your father 
Both in your form and nobleness of mind 
Laid open all your victories in Scotland 
Your discipline in war  wisdom in peace 
Your bounty  virtue  fair humility 
Indeed  left nothing fitting for your purpose 
Untouchd or slightly handled in discourse 
And when my oratory drew toward end 
I bade them that did love their countrys good 
Cry God save Richard  Englands royal king  

And did they so 

No  so God help me  they spake not a word 
But  like dumb statuas or breathing stones 
Stard each on other  and lookd deadly pale 
Which when I saw  I reprehended them 
And askd the mayor what meant this wilful silence 
His answer was  the people were not wont 
To be spoke to but by the recorder 
Then he was urgd to tell my tale again 
Thus saith the duke  thus hath the duke inferrd  
But nothing spoke in warrant from himself 
When he had done  some followers of mine own 
At lower end of the hall  hurld up their caps 
And some ten voices cried  God save King Richard  
And thus I took the vantage of those few 
Thanks  gentle citizens and friends  quoth I 
This general applause and cheerful shout 
Argues your wisdom and your love to Richard  
And even here brake off  and came away 

What tongueless blocks were they  would they not speak 
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come 

The mayor is here at hand  Intend some fear 
Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit 
And look you get a prayerbook in your hand 
And stand between two churchmen  good my lord 
For on that ground Ill make a holy descant 
And be not easily won to our requests 
Play the maids part  still answer nay  and take it 

I go  and if you plead as well for them 
As I can say nay to thee for myself 
No doubt we bring it to a happy issue 

Go  go  up to the leads  the Lord Mayor knocks 

Welcome  my lord  I dance attendance here 
I think the duke will not be spoke withal 


Now  Catesby  what says your lord to my request 

He doth entreat your Grace  my noble lord 
To visit him tomorrow or next day 
He is within  with two right reverend fathers 
Divinely bent to meditation 
And in no worldly suit would he be movd 
To draw him from his holy exercise 

Return  good Catesby  to the gracious duke 
Tell him  myself  the mayor and aldermen 
In deep designs in matter of great moment 
No less importing than our general good 
Are come to have some conference with his Grace 

Ill signify so much unto him straight 


Ah  ha  my lord  this prince is not an Edward 
He is not lolling on a lewd daybed 
But on his knees at meditation 
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans 
But meditating with two deep divines 
Not sleeping  to engross his idle body 
But praying  to enrich his watchful soul 
Happy were England  would this virtuous prince 
Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof 
But sore  I fear  we shall not win him to it 

Marry  God defend his Grace should say us nay 

I fear he will  Here Catesby comes again 

Now  Catesby  what says his Grace 

He wonders to what end you have assembled 
Such troops of citizens to come to him 
His Grace not being warnd thereof before 
My lord  he fears you mean no good to him 

Sorry I am my noble cousin should 
Suspect me that I mean no good to him 
By heaven  we come to him in perfect love 
And so once more return  and tell his Grace 

When holy and devout religious men 
Are at their beads  tis much to draw them thence 
So sweet is zealous contemplation 


See  where his Grace stands tween two clergymen 

Two props of virtue for a Christian prince 
To stay him from the fall of vanity 
And  see  a book of prayer in his hand 
True ornament to know a holy man 
Famous Plantagenet  most gracious prince 
Lend favourable ear to our requests 
And pardon us the interruption 
Of thy devotion  and right Christian zeal 

My lord  there needs no such apology 
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me 
Who  earnest in the service of my God 
Deferrd the visitation of my friends 
But  leaving this  what is your Graces pleasure 

Even that  I hope  which pleaseth God above 
And all good men of this ungovernd isle 

I do suspect I have done some offence 
That seems disgracious in the citys eye 
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance 

You have  my lord  would it might please your Grace 
On our entreaties to amend your fault 

Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land 

Know then  it is your fault that you resign 
The supreme seat  the throne majestical 
The sceptred office of your ancestors 
Your state of fortune and your due of birth 
The lineal glory of your royal house 
To the corruption of a blemishd stock 
Whiles  in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts 
Which here we waken to our countrys good 
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs 
Her face defacd with scars of infamy 
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants 
And almost shoulderd in the swallowing gulf 
Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion 
Which to recure we heartily solicit 
Your gracious self to take on you the charge 
And kingly government of this your land 
Not as protector  steward  substitute 
Or lowly factor for anothers gain 
But as successively from blood to blood 
Your right of birth  your empery  your own 
For this  consorted with the citizens 
Your very worshipful and loving friends 
And by their vehement instigation 
In this just cause come I to move your Grace 

I cannot tell  if to depart in silence 
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof 
Best fitteth my degree or your condition 
If not to answer  you might haply think 
Tonguetied ambition  not replying  yielded 
To bear the golden yoke of sovreignty 
Which fondly you would here impose on me 
If to reprove you for this suit of yours 
So seasond with your faithful love to me 
Then  on the other side  I checkd my friends 
Therefore  to speak  and to avoid the first 
And then  in speaking  not to incur the last 
Definitively thus I answer you 
Your love deserves my thanks  but my desert 
Unmeritable shuns your high request 
First  if all obstacles were cut away 
And that my path were even to the crown 
As the ripe revenue and due of birth 
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit 
So mighty and so many my defects 
That I would rather hide me from my greatness 
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea 
Than in my greatness covet to be hid 
And in the vapour of my glory smotherd 
But  God be thankd  there is no need of me 
And much I need to help you  were there need 
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit 
Which  mellowd by the stealing hours of time 
Will well become the seat of majesty 
And make  no doubt  us happy by his reign 
On him I lay that you would lay on me 
The right and fortune of his happy stars 
Which God defend that I should wring from him 

My lord  this argues conscience in your Grace 
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial 
All circumstances well considered 
You say that Edward is your brothers son 
So say we too  but not by Edwards wife 
For first was he contract to Lady Lucy 
Your mother lives a witness to his vow 
And afterward by substitute betrothd 
To Bona  sister to the King of France 
These both put by  a poor petitioner 
A carecrazd mother to a many sons 
A beautywaning and distressed widow 
Even in the afternoon of her best days 
Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye 
Seducd the pitch and height of his degree 
To base declension and loathd bigamy 
By her  in his unlawful bed  he got 
This Edward  whom our manners call the prince 
More bitterly could I expostulate 
Save that  for reverence to some alive 
I give a sparing limit to my tongue 
Then  good my lord  take to your royal self 
This profferd benefit of dignity 
If not to bless us and the land withal 
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry 
From the corruption of abusing times 
Unto a lineal truederived course 

Do  good my lord  your citizens entreat you 

Refuse not  mighty lord  this profferd love 

O  make them joyful  grant their lawful suit 

Alas  why would you heap those cares on me 
I am unfit for state and majesty 
I do beseech you  take it not amiss 
I cannot nor I will not yield to you 

If you refuse it  as  in love and zeal 
Loath to depose the child  your brothers son 
As well we know your tenderness of heart 
And gentle  kind  effeminate remorse 
Which we have noted in you to your kindred 
And egally  indeed  to all estates 
Yet whether you accept our suit or no 
Your brothers son shall never reign our king 
But we will plant some other in the throne 
To the disgrace and downfall of your house 
And in this resolution here we leave you 
Come  citizens  we will entreat no more 


Call them again  sweet prince  accept their suit 
If you deny them  all the land will rue it 

Will you enforce me to a world of cares 
Call them again  I am not made of stone 
But penetrable to your kind entreats 

Albeit against my conscience and my soul 


Cousin of Buckingham  and sage  grave men 
Since you will buckle fortune on my back 
To bear her burden  wher I will or no 
I must have patience to endure the load 
But if black scandal or foulfacd reproach 
Attend the sequel of your imposition 
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me 
From all the impure blots and stains thereof 
For God doth know  and you may partly see 

How far I am from the desire of this 

God bless your Grace  we see it  and will say it 

In saying so  you shall but say the truth 

Then I salute you with this royal title 
Long live King Richard  Englands worthy king 

Amen 

Tomorrow may it please you to be crownd 

Even when you please  for you will have it so 

Tomorrow then we will attend your Grace 
And so most joyfully we take our leave 

Come  let us to our holy work again 
Farewell  my cousin farewell  gentle friends 

Who meets us here  my niece Plantagenet 
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester 
Now  for my life  shes wandring to the Tower 
On pure hearts love  to greet the tender princes 
Daughter  well met 

God give your Graces both 
A happy and a joyful time of day 

As much to you  good sister  whither away 

No further than the Tower  and  as I guess 
Upon the like devotion as yourselves 
To gratulate the gentle princes there 

Kind sister  thanks  well enter all together 


And  in good time  here the lieutenant comes 
Master lieutenant  pray you  by your leave 

How doth the prince  and my young son of York 

Right well  dear madam  By your patience 
I may not suffer you to visit them 
The king hath strictly chargd the contrary 

The king  whos that 

I mean the Lord Protector 

The Lord protect him from that kingly title 
Hath he set bounds between their love and me 
I am their mother  who shall bar me from them 

I am their fathers mother  I will see them 

Their aunt I am in law  in love their mother 
Then bring me to their sights  Ill bear thy blame 
And take thy office from thee  on my peril 

No  madam  no  I may not leave it so 
I am bound by oath  and therefore pardon me 

Let me but meet you  ladies  one hour hence 
And Ill salute your Grace of York as mother 
And reverend lookeron of two fair queens 


Come  madam  you must straight to Westminster 
There to be crowned Richards royal queen 

Ah  cut my lace asunder 
That my pent heart may have some scope to beat 
Or else I swoon with this deadkilling news 

Despiteful tidings  O  unpleasing news 

Be of good cheer  mother  how fares your Grace 

O  Dorset  speak not to me  get thee gone 
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels 
Thy mothers name is ominous to children 
If thou wilt outstrip death  go cross the seas 
And live with Richmond  from the reach of hell 
Go  hie thee  hie thee  from this slaughterhouse 
Lest thou increase the number of the dead 
And make me die the thrall of Margarets curse 
Nor mother  wife  nor Englands counted queen 

Full of wise care is this your counsel  madam 


Take all the swift advantage of the hours 
You shall have letters from me to my son 
In your behalf  to meet you on the way 
Be not taen tardy by unwise delay 

O illdispersing wind of misery 
O  my accursed womb  the bed of death 
A cockatrice hast thou hatchd to the world 
Whose unavoided eye is murderous 

Come  madam  come  I in all haste was sent 

And I with all unwillingness will go 
O  would to God that the inclusive verge 
Of golden metal that must round my brow 
Were redhot steel to sear me to the brain 
Anointed let me be with deadly venom 
And die  ere men can say God save the queen  

Go  go  poor soul  I envy not thy glory 
To feed my humour  wish thyself no harm 

No  why  When he  that is my husband now 
Came to me  as I followd Henrys corse 
When scarce the blood was well washd from his hands 
Which issud from my other angel husband 
And that dead saint which then I weeping followd 
O  when I say  I lookd on Richards face 
This was my wish  Be thou  quoth I  accursd 
For making me so young  so old a widow 
And  when thou weddst  let sorrow haunt thy bed 
And be thy wife if any be so mad 
More miserable by the life of thee 
Than thou hast made me by my dear lords death  
Lo  ere I can repeat this curse again 
Within so small a time  my womans heart 
Grossly grew captive to his honey words 
And provd the subject of mine own souls curse 
Which hitherto hath held mine eyes from rest 
For never yet one hour in his bed 
Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep 
But with his timorous dreams was still awakd 
Besides  he hates me for my father Warwick 
And will  no doubt  shortly be rid of me 

Poor heart  adieu  I pity thy complaining 

No more than with my soul I mourn for yours 

Farewell  thou woeful welcomer of glory 

Adieu  poor soul  that takst thy leave of it 

Go thou to Richmond  and good fortune guide thee 


Go thou to Richard  and good angels tend thee 


Go thou to sanctuary  and good thoughts possess thee 
I to my grave  where peace and rest lie with me 
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen 
And each hours joy wrackd with a week of teen 

Stay yet  look back with me unto the Tower 
Pity  you ancient stones  those tender babes 
Whom envy hath immurd within your walls 
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones 
Rude ragged nurse  old sullen playfellow 
For tender princes  use my babies well 
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell 


Stand all apart  Cousin of Buckingham 

My gracious sovereign 

Give me thy hand 

Thus high  by thy advice 
And thy assistance  is King Richard seated 
But shall we wear these glories for a day 
Or shall they last  and we rejoice in them 

Still live they  and for ever let them last 

Ah  Buckingham  now do I play the touch 
To try if thou be current gold indeed 
Young Edward lives  think now what I would speak 

Say on  my loving lord 

Why  Buckingham  I say  I would be king 

Why  so you are  my thricerenowned liege 

Ha  am I king  Tis so  but Edward lives 

True  noble prince 

O bitter consequence 
That Edward still should live  True  noble prince  
Cousin  thou wast not wont to be so dull 
Shall I be plain  I wish the bastards dead 
And I would have it suddenly performd 
What sayst thou now  speak suddenly  be brief 

Your Grace may do your pleasure 

Tut  tut  thou art all ice  thy kindness freezes 
Say  have I thy consent that they shall die 

Give me some little breath  some pause  dear lord 
Before I positively speak in this 
I will resolve you herein presently 


The king is angry  see  he gnaws his lip 

I will converse with ironwitted fools 
And unrespective boys  none are for me 
That look into me with considerate eyes 
Highreaching Buckingham grows circumspect 
Boy 

My lord 

Knowst thou not any whom corrupting gold 
Will tempt unto a close exploit of death 

I know a discontented gentleman 
Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit 
Gold were as good as twenty orators 
And will  no doubt  tempt him to anything 

What is his name 

His name  my lord  is Tyrrell 

I partly know the man  go  call him hither 

The deeprevolving witty Buckingham 
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel 
Hath he so long held out with me untird 
And stops he now for breath  well  be it so 

How now  Lord Stanley  whats the news 

Know  my loving lord 
The Marquess Dorset  as I hear  is fled 
To Richmond  in the parts where he abides 

Come hither  Catesby  rumour it abroad 
That Anne my wife is very grievous sick 
I will take order for her keeping close 
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman 
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence daughter 
The boy is foolish  and I fear not him 
Look  how thou dreamst  I say again  give out 
That Anne my queen is sick  and like to die 
About it  for it stands me much upon 
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me 

I must be married to my brothers daughter 
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass 
Murder her brothers  and then marry her 
Uncertain way of gain  But I am in 
So far in blood  that sin will pluck on sin 
Tearfalling pity dwells not in this eye 

Is thy name Tyrrell 

James Tyrrell  and your most obedient subject 

Art thou  indeed 

Prove me  my gracious lord 

Darst thou resolve to kill a friend of mine 

Please you  but I had rather kill two enemies 

Why  then thou hast it  two deep enemies 
Foes to my rest  and my sweet sleeps disturbers 
Are they that I would have thee deal upon 
Tyrrell  I mean those bastards in the Tower 

Let me have open means to come to them 
And soon Ill rid you from the fear of them 

Thou singst sweet music  Hark  come hither  Tyrrell 
Go  by this token  rise  and lend thine ear 

There is no more but so  say it is done 
And I will love thee  and prefer thee for it 

I will dispatch it straight 

My lord  I have considerd in my mind 
The late demand that you did sound me in 

Well  let that rest  Dorset is fled to Richmond 

I hear the news  my lord 

Stanley  he is your wifes son  well  look to it 

My lord  I claim the gift  my due by promise 
For which your honour and your faith is pawnd 
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables 
Which you have promised I shall possess 

Stanley  look to your wife  if she convey 
Letters to Richmond  you shall answer it 

What says your highness to my just request 

I do remember me  Henry the Sixth 
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king 
When Richmond was a little peevish boy 
A king  perhaps 

My lord 

How chance the prophet could not at that time 
Have told me  I being by  that I should kill him 

My lord  your promise for the earldom 

Richmond  When last I was at Exeter 
The mayor in courtesy showd me the castle 
And calld it Rougemont  at which name I started 
Because a bard of Ireland told me once 
I should not live long after I saw Richmond 

My lord 

Ay  whats oclock 

I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind 
Of what you promisd me 

Well  but what ist oclock 

Upon the stroke of ten 

Well  let it strike 

Why let it strike 

Because that  like a Jack  thou keepst the stroke 
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation 
I am not in the giving vein today 

Why  then resolve me wher you will  or no 

Thou troublest me  I am not in the vein 


And is it thus  repays he my deep service 
With such contempt  made I him king for this 
O  let me think on Hastings  and be gone 
To Brecknock  while my fearful head is on 


The tyrannous and bloody act is done 
The most arch deed of piteous massacre 
That ever yet this land was guilty of 
Dighton and Forrest  whom I did suborn 
To do this piece of ruthless butchery 
Albeit they were fleshd villains  bloody dogs 
Melting with tenderness and mild compassion 
Wept like to children in their deaths sad story 
Oh  thus  quoth Dighton  lay the gentle babes  
Thus  thus  quoth Forrest  girdling one another 
Within their alabaster innocent arms 
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk 
Which in their summer beauty kissd each other 
A book of prayers on their pillow lay 
Which once  quoth Forrest  almost changd my mind 
But  O  the devil there the villain stoppd 
When Dighton thus told on  We smothered 
The most replenished sweet work of nature 
That from the prime creation eer she framd  
Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse 
They could not speak  and so I left them both 
To bear this tidings to the bloody king 
And here he comes 

All health  my sovereign lord 

Kind Tyrrell  am I happy in thy news 

If to have done the thing you gave in charge 
Beget your happiness  be happy then 
For it is done 

But didst thou see them dead 

I did  my lord 

And buried  gentle Tyrrell 

The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them 
But how or in what place I do not know 

Come to me  Tyrrell  soon at aftersupper 
When thou shalt tell the process of their death 
Meantime  but think how I may do thee good 
And be inheritor of thy desire 
Farewell till then 

I humbly take my leave 


The son of Clarence have I pent up close 
His daughter meanly have I matchd in marriage 
The sons of Edward sleep in Abrahams bosom 
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night 
Now  for I know the Breton Richmond aims 
At young Elizabeth  my brothers daughter 
And  by that knot  looks proudly on the crown 
To her go I  a jolly thriving wooer 


My lord 

Good or bad news  that thou comst in so bluntly 

Bad news  my lord  Morton is fled to Richmond 
And Buckingham  backd with the hardy Welshmen 
Is in the field  and still his power increaseth 

Ely with Richmond troubles me more near 
Than Buckingham and his rashlevied strength 
Come  I have learnd that fearful commenting 
Is leaden servitor to dull delay 
Delay leads impotent and snailpacd beggary 
Then fiery expedition be my wing 
Joves Mercury  and herald for a king 
Go  muster men  my counsel is my shield 
We must be brief when traitors brave the field 


So  now prosperity begins to mellow 
And drop into the rotten mouth of death 
Here in these confines slily have I lurkd 
To watch the waning of mine enemies 
A dire induction am I witness to 
And will to France  hoping the consequence 
Will prove as bitter  black  and tragical 
Withdraw thee  wretched Margaret  who comes here 


Ah  my poor princes  ah  my tender babes 
My unblown flowers  newappearing sweets 
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air 
And be not fixd in doom perpetual 
Hover about me with your airy wings 
And hear your mothers lamentation 

Hover about her  say  that right for right 
Hath dimmd your infant morn to aged night 

So many miseries have crazd my voice 
That my woewearied tongue is still and mute 
Edward Plantagenet  why art thou dead 

Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet 
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt 

Wilt thou  O God  fly from such gentle lambs 
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf 
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done 

When holy Harry died  and my sweet son 

Dead life  blind sight  poor mortal living ghost 
Woes scene  worlds shame  graves due by life usurpd 
Brief abstract and record of tedious days 
Rest thy unrest on Englands lawful earth 

Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood 

Ah  that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave 
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat 
Then would I hide my bones  not rest them here 
Ah  who hath any cause to mourn but I 


If ancient sorrow be most reverend 
Give mine the benefit of seniory 
And let my griefs frown on the upper hand 
If sorrow can admit society 

Tell oer your woes again by viewing mine 
I had an Edward  till a Richard killd him 
I had a Harry  till a Richard killd him 
Thou hadst an Edward  till a Richard killd him 
Thou hadst a Richard  till a Richard killd him 

I had a Richard too  and thou didst kill him 
I had a Rutland too  thou holpst to kill him 

Thou hadst a Clarence too  and Richard killd him 
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept 
A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death 
That dog  that had his teeth before his eyes 
To worry lambs  and lap their gentle blood 
That foul defacer of Gods handiwork 
That excellent grandtyrant of the earth 
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls 
Thy womb let loose  to chase us to our graves 
O  upright  just  and truedisposing God 
How do I thank thee that this carnal cur 
Preys on the issue of his mothers body 
And makes her pewfellow with others moan 

O  Harrys wife  triumph not in my woes 
God witness with me  I have wept for thine 

Bear with me  I am hungry for revenge 
And now I cloy me with beholding it 
Thy Edward he is dead  that killd my Edward 
Thy other Edward dead  to quit my Edward 
Young York he is but boot  because both they 
Match not the high perfection of my loss 
Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbd my Edward 
And the beholders of this tragic play 
The adulterate Hastings  Rivers  Vaughan  Grey 
Untimely smotherd in their dusky graves 
Richard yet lives  hells black intelligencer 
Only reservd their factor  to buy souls 
And send them thither  but at hand  at hand 
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end 
Earth gapes  hell burns  fiends roar  saints pray 
To have him suddenly conveyd from hence 
Cancel his bond of life  dear God  I pray 
That I may live to say  The dog is dead 

O  thou didst prophesy the time would come 
That I should wish for thee to help me curse 
That bottled spider  that foul bunchbackd toad 

I calld thee then vain flourish of my fortune 
I calld thee then poor shadow  painted queen 
The presentation of but what I was 
The flattering index of a direful pageant 
One heavd ahigh to be hurld down below 
A mother only mockd with two fair babes 
A dream of what thou wert  a breath  a bubble 
A sign of dignity  a garish flag 
To be the aim of every dangerous shot 
A queen in jest  only to fill the scene 
Where is thy husband now  where be thy brothers 
Where are thy children  wherein dost thou joy 
Who sues and kneels and cries God save the queen 
Where be the bending peers that flatterd thee 
Where be the thronging troops that followd thee 
Decline all this  and see what now thou art 
For happy wife  a most distressed widow 
For joyful mother  one that wails the name 
For one being sud to  one that humbly sues 
For queen  a very caitiff crownd with care 
For one that scornd at me  now scornd of me 
For one being feard of all  now fearing one 
For one commanding all  obeyd of none 
Thus hath the course of justice whirld about 
And left thee but a very prey to time 
Having no more but thought of what thou wert 
To torture thee the more  being what thou art 
Thou didst usurp my place  and dost thou not 
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow 
Now thy proud neck bears half my burdend yoke 
From which even here  I slip my wearied head 
And leave the burden of it all on thee 
Farewell  Yorks wife  and queen of sad mischance 
These English woes shall make me smile in France 

O thou  well skilld in curses  stay awhile 
And teach me how to curse mine enemies 

Forbear to sleep the night  and fast the day 
Compare dead happiness with living woe 
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were 
And he that slew them fouler than he is 
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse 
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse 

My words are dull  O  quicken them with thine 

Thy woes will make them sharp  and pierce like mine 


Why should calamity be full of words 

Windy attorneys to their client woes 
Airy succeeders of intestate joys 
Poor breathing orators of miseries 
Let them have scope  though what they do impart 
Help nothing else  yet do they ease the heart 

If so  then be not tonguetied  go with me 
And in the breath of bitter words lets smother 
My damned son  that thy two sweet sons smotherd 

The trumpet sounds  be copious in exclaims 


Who intercepts me in my expedition 

O  she that might have intercepted thee 
By strangling thee in her accursed womb 
From all the slaughters  wretch  that thou hast done 

Hidst thou that forehead with a golden crown 
Where should be branded  if that right were right 
The slaughter of the prince that owd that crown 
And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers 
Tell me  thou villain slave  where are my children 

Thou toad  thou toad  where is thy brother Clarence 
And little Ned Plantagenet  his son 

Where is the gentle Rivers  Vaughan  Grey 

Where is kind Hastings 

A flourish  trumpets  strike alarum  drums 
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women 
Rail on the Lords anointed  Strike  I say 

Either be patient  and entreat me fair 
Or with the clamorous report of war 
Thus will I drown your exclamations 

Art thou my son 

Ay  I thank God  my father  and yourself 

Then patiently hear my impatience 

Madam  I have a touch of your condition 
That cannot brook the accent of reproof 

O  let me speak 

Do  then  but Ill not hear 

I will be mild and gentle in my words 

And brief  good mother  for I am in haste 

Art thou so hasty  I have stayd for thee 
God knows  in torment and in agony 

And came I not at last to comfort you 

No  by the holy rood  thou knowst it well 
Thou camst on earth to make the earth my hell 
A grievous burden was thy birth to me 
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy 
Thy schooldays frightful  desperate  wild and furious 
Thy prime of manhood daring  bold  and venturous 
Thy age confirmd  proud  subtle  sly  and bloody 
More mild  but yet more harmful  kind in hatred 
What comfortable hour canst thou name 
That ever gracd me in thy company 

Faith  none  but Humphrey Hour  that calld your Grace 
To breakfast once forth of my company 
If I be so disgracious in your eye 
Let me march on  and not offend you  madam 
Strike up the drum 

I prithee  hear me speak 

You speak too bitterly 

Hear me a word 
For I shall never speak to thee again 

So 

Either thou wilt die by Gods just ordinance 
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror 
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish 
And never look upon thy face again 
Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse 
Which  in the day of battle  tire thee more 
Than all the complete armour that thou wearst 
My prayers on the adverse party fight 
And there the little souls of Edwards children 
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies 
And promise them success and victory 
Bloody thou art  bloody will be thy end 
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend 


Though far more cause  yet much less spirit to curse 
Abides in me  I say amen to her 


Stay  madam  I must talk a word with you 

I have no moe sons of the royal blood 
For thee to slaughter  for my daughters  Richard 
They shall be praying nuns  not weeping queens 
And therefore level not to hit their lives 

You have a daughter calld Elizabeth 
Virtuous and fair  royal and gracious 

And must she die for this  O  let her live 
And Ill corrupt her manners  stain her beauty 
Slander myself as false to Edwards bed 
Throw over her the veil of infamy 
So she may live unscarrd of bleeding slaughter 
I will confess she was not Edwards daughter 

Wrong not her birth  she is of royal blood 

To save her life  Ill say she is not so 

Her life is safest only in her birth 

And only in that safety died her brothers 

Lo  at their births good stars were opposite 

No  to their lives ill friends were contrary 

All unavoided is the doom of destiny 

True  when avoided grace makes destiny 
My babes were destind to a fairer death 
If grace had blessd thee with a fairer life 

You speak as if that I had slain my cousins 

Cousins  indeed  and by their uncle cozend 
Of comfort  kingdom  kindred  freedom  life 
Whose hands soever lancd their tender hearts 
Thy head  all indirectly  gave direction 
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt 
Till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart 
To revel in the entrails of my lambs 
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame 
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys 
Till that my nails were anchord in thine eyes 
And I  in such a desperate bay of death 
Like a poor bark  of sails and tackling reft 
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom 

Madam  so thrive I in my enterprise 
And dangerous success of bloody wars 
As I intend more good to you and yours 
Than ever you or yours by me were harmd 

What good is coverd with the face of heaven 
To be discoverd  that can do me good 

The advancement of your children  gentle lady 

Up to some scaffold  there to lose their heads 

No  to the dignity and height of fortune 
The high imperial type of this earths glory 

Flatter my sorrow with report of it 
Tell me what state  what dignity  what honour 
Canst thou demise to any child of mine 

Even all I have  ay  and myself and all 
Will I withal endow a child of thine 
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul 
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs 
Which thou supposest I have done to thee 

Be brief  lest that the process of thy kindness 
Last longer telling than thy kindness date 

Then know  that from my soul I love thy daughter 

My daughters mother thinks it with her soul 

What do you think 

That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul 
So from thy souls love didst thou love her brothers 
And from my hearts love I do thank thee for it 

Be not too hasty to confound my meaning 
I mean  that with my soul I love thy daughter 
And do intend to make her Queen of England 

Well then  who dost thou mean shall be her king 

Even he that makes her queen  who else should be 

What  thou 

Even so  what think you of it 

How canst thou woo her 

That I would learn of you 
As one being best acquainted with her humour 

And wilt thou learn of me 

Madam  with all my heart 

Send to her  by the man that slew her brothers 
A pair of bleeding hearts  thereon engrave 
Edward and York  then haply will she weep 
Therefore present to her  as sometime Margaret 
Did to thy father  steepd in Rutlands blood 
A handkerchief  which  say to her  did drain 
The purple sap from her sweet brothers body 
And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal 
If this inducement move her not to love 
Send her a letter of thy noble deeds 
Tell her thou madst away her uncle Clarence 
Her uncle Rivers  ay  and for her sake 
Madst quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne 

You mock me  madam  this is not the way 
To win your daughter 

There is no other way 
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape 
And not be Richard that hath done all this 

Say  that I did all this for love of her 

Nay  then indeed  she cannot choose but hate thee 
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil 

Look  what is done cannot be now amended 
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes 
Which afterhours give leisure to repent 
If I did take the kingdom from your sons 
To make amends Ill give it to your daughter 
If I have killd the issue of your womb 
To quicken your increase  I will beget 
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter 
A grandams name is little less in love 
Than is the doting title of a mother 
They are as children but one step below 
Even of your mettle  of your very blood 
Of all one pain  save for a night of groans 
Endurd of her for whom you bid like sorrow 
Your children were vexation to your youth 
But mine shall be a comfort to your age 
The loss you have is but a son being king 
And by that loss your daughter is made queen 
I cannot make you what amends I would 
Therefore accept such kindness as I can 
Dorset your son  that with a fearful soul 
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil 
This fair alliance quickly shall call home 
To high promotions and great dignity 
The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife 
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother 
Again shall you be mother to a king 
And all the ruins of distressful times 
Repaird with double riches of content 
What  we have many goodly days to see 
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed 
Shall come again  transformd to orient pearl 
Advantaging their loan with interest 
Of ten times double gain of happiness 
Go then  my mother  to thy daughter go 
Make bold her bashful years with your experience 
Prepare her ears to hear a wooers tale 
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame 
Of golden sovereignty  acquaint the princess 
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys 
And when this arm of mine hath chastised 
The petty rebel  dullbraind Buckingham 
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come 
And lead thy daughter to a conquerors bed 
To whom I will retail my conquest won 
And she shall be sole victress  C sars C sar 

What were I best to say  her fathers brother 
Would be her lord  Or shall I say  her uncle 
Or  he that slew her brothers and her uncles 
Under what title shall I woo for thee 
That God  the law  my honour  and her love 
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years 

Infer fair Englands peace by this alliance 

Which she shall purchase with still lasting war 

Tell her  the king  that may command  entreats 

That at her hands which the kings King forbids 

Say  she shall be a high and mighty queen 

To wail the title  as her mother doth 

Say  I will love her everlastingly 

But how long shall that title ever last 

Sweetly in force unto her fair lifes end 

But how long fairly shall her sweet life last 

As long as heaven and nature lengthens it 

As long as hell and Richard likes of it 

Say  I  her sovereign  am her subject low 

But she  your subject  loathes such sovereignty 

Be eloquent in my behalf to her 

An honest tale speeds best being plainly told 

Then plainly to her tell my loving tale 

Plain and not honest is too harsh a style 

Your reasons are too shallow and too quick 

O  no  my reasons are too deep and dead 
Too deep and dead  poor infants  in their graves 

Harp not on that string  madam  that is past 

Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings break 

Now  by my George  my garter  and my crown 

Profand  dishonourd  and the third usurpd 

I swear 

By nothing  for this is no oath 
Thy George  profand  hath lost his holy honour 
Thy garter  blemishd  pawnd his knightly virtue 
Thy crown  usurpd  disgracd his kingly glory 
If something thou wouldst swear to be believd 
Swear  then  by something that thou hast not wrongd 

Now  by the world 

Tis full of thy foul wrongs 

My fathers death 

Thy life hath that dishonourd 

Then  by myself 

Thyself is selfmisusd 

Why  then  by God 

Gods wrong is most of all 
If thou hadst feard to break an oath by him 
The unity the king my husband made 
Had not been broken  nor my brothers died 
If thou hadst feard to break an oath by him 
The imperial metal  circling now thy head 
Had gracd the tender temples of my child 
And both the princes had been breathing here 
Which now  too tender bedfellows for dust 
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms 
What canst thou swear by now 

The time to come 

That thou hast wronged in the time oerpast 
For I myself have many tears to wash 
Hereafter time for time past wrongd by thee 
The children live  whose parents thou hast slaughterd 
Ungovernd youth  to wail it in their age 
The parents live  whose children thou hast butcherd 
Old barren plants  to wail it with their age 
Swear not by time to come  for that thou hast 
Misusd ere usd  by times illusd oerpast 

As I intend to prosper  and repent 
So thrive I in my dangerous affairs 
Of hostile arms  myself myself confound 
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours 
Day  yield me not thy light  nor  night  thy rest 
Be opposite all planets of good luck 
To my proceeding  if  with pure hearts love 
Immaculate devotion  holy thoughts 
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter 
In her consists my happiness and thine 
Without her  follows to myself  and thee 
Herself  the land  and many a Christian soul 
Death  desolation  ruin  and decay 
It cannot be avoided but by this 
It will not be avoided but by this 
Therefore  dear mother I must call you so 
Be the attorney of my love to her 
Plead what I will be  not what I have been 
Not my deserts  but what I will deserve 
Urge the necessity and state of times 
And be not peevishfond in great designs 

Shall I be tempted of the devil thus 

Ay  if the devil tempt thee to do good 

Shall I forget myself to be myself 

Ay  if your selfs remembrance wrong yourself 

Yet thou didst kill my children 

But in your daughters womb I bury them 
Where  in that nest of spicery  they shall breed 
Selves of themselves  to your recomforture 

Shall I go win my daughter to thy will 

And be a happy mother by the deed 

I go  Write to me very shortly 
And you shall understand from me her mind 

Bear her my true loves kiss  and so farewell 

Relenting fool  and shallow changing woman 

How now  what news 

Most mighty sovereign  on the western coast 
Rideth a puissant navy  to the shores 
Throng many doubtful hollowhearted friends 
Unarmd  and unresolvd to beat them back 
Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral 
And there they hull  expecting but the aid 
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore 

Some lightfoot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk 
Ratcliff  thyself  or Catesby  where is he 

Here  my good lord 

Catesby  fly to the duke 

I will  my lord  with all convenient haste 

Ratcliff  come hither  Post to Salisbury 
When thou comst thither 

Dull  unmindful villain 
Why stayst thou here  and gost not to the duke 

First  mighty liege  tell me your highness pleasure 
What from your Grace I shall deliver to him 

O  true  good Catesby  bid him levy straight 
The greatest strength and power he can make 
And meet me suddenly at Salisbury 

I go 


What  may it please you  shall I do at Salisbury 

Why  what wouldst thou do there before I go 

Your highness told me I should post before 


My mind is changd  Stanley  what news with you 

None good  my liege  to please you with the hearing 
Nor none so bad but well may be reported 

Hoyday  a riddle  neither good nor bad 
What needst thou run so many miles about 
When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way 
Once more  what news 

Richmond is on the seas 

There let him sink  and be the seas on him 
Whiteliverd runagate  what doth he there 

I know not  mighty sovereign  but by guess 

Well  as you guess 

Stirrd up by Dorset  Buckingham  and Morton 
He makes for England  here to claim the crown 

Is the chair empty  is the sword unswayd 
Is the king dead  the empire unpossessd 
What heir of York is there alive but we 
And who is Englands king but great Yorks heir 
Then  tell me  what makes he upon the seas 

Unless for that  my liege  I cannot guess 

Unless for that he comes to be your liege 
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes 
Thou wilt revolt and fly to him I fear 

No  my good lord  therefore mistrust me not 

Where is thy power then to beat him back 
Where be thy tenants and thy followers 
Are they not now upon the western shore 
Safeconducting the rebels from their ships 

No  my good lord  my friends are in the north 

Cold friends to me  what do they in the north 
When they should serve their sovereign in the west 

They have not been commanded  mighty king 
Pleaseth your majesty to give me leave 
Ill muster up my friends  and meet your Grace 
Where and what time your majesty shall please 

Ay  ay  thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond 
But Ill not trust thee 

Most mighty sovereign 
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful 
I never was nor never will be false 

Go then and muster men  but leave behind 
Your son  George Stanley  look your heart be firm 
Or else his heads assurance is but frail 

So deal with him as I prove true to you 

My gracious sovereign  now in Devonshire 
As I by friends am well advertised 
Sir Edward Courtney  and the haughty prelate 
Bishop of Exeter  his brother there 
With many moe confederates are in arms 


In Kent  my liege  the Guildfords are in arms 
And every hour more competitors 
Flock to the rebels  and their power grows strong 


My lord  the army of great Buckingham 

Out on ye  owls  nothing but songs of death 

There  take thou that  till thou bring better news 

The news I have to tell your majesty 
Is  that by sudden floods and fall of waters 
Buckinghams army is dispersd and scatterd 
And he himself wanderd away alone 
No man knows whither 

I cry thee mercy 
There is my purse  to cure that blow of thine 
Hath any welladvised friend proclaimd 
Reward to him that brings the traitor in 

Such proclamation hath been made  my liege 


Sir Thomas Lovel  and Lord Marquess Dorset 
Tis said  my liege  in Yorkshire are in arms 
But this good comfort bring I to your highness 
The Breton navy is dispersd by tempest 
Richmond  in Dorsetshire  sent out a boat 
Unto the shore to ask those on the banks 
If they were his assistants  yea or no 
Who answerd him  they came from Buckingham 
Upon his party  he  mistrusting them 
Hoisd sail  and made away for Brittany 

March on  march on  since we are up in arms 
If not to fight with foreign enemies 
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home 


My liege  the Duke of Buckingham is taken 
That is the best news  that the Earl of Richmond 
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford 
Is colder news  but yet they must be told 

Away towards Salisbury  while we reason here 
A royal battle might be won and lost 
Some one take order Buckingham be brought 
To Salisbury  the rest march on with me 


Sir Christopher  tell Richmond this from me 
That in the sty of this most bloody boar 
My son George Stanley is frankd up in hold 
If I revolt  off goes young Georges head 
The fear of that holds off my present aid 
So  get thee gone  commend me to thy lord 
Withal  say that the queen hath heartily consented 
He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter 
But  tell me  where is princely Richmond now 

At Pembroke  or at Harfordwest  in Wales 

What men of name resort to him 

Sir Walter Herbert  a renowned soldier 
Sir Gilbert Talbot  Sir William Stanley 
Oxford  redoubted Pembroke  Sir James Blunt 
And Rice ap Thomas  with a valiant crew 
And many other of great name and worth 
And towards London do they bend their power 
If by the way they be not fought withal 

Well  hie thee to thy lord  I kiss his hand 
My letter will resolve him of my mind 
Farewell 

Will not King Richard let me speak with him 

No  my good lord  therefore be patient 

Hastings  and Edwards children  Grey and Rivers 
Holy King Henry  and thy fair son Edward 
Vaughan  and all that have miscarried 
By underhand corrupted foul injustice 
If that your moody discontented souls 
Do through the clouds behold this present hour 
Even for revenge mock my destruction 
This is AllSouls day  fellows  is it not 

It is  my lord 

Why  then AllSouls day is my bodys doomsday 
This is the day that  in King Edwards time 
I wishd might fall on me  when I was found 
False to his children or his wifes allies 
This is the day wherein I wishd to fall 
By the false faith of him whom most I trusted 
This  this AllSouls day to my fearful soul 
Is the determind respite of my wrongs 
That high AllSeer which I dallied with 
Hath turnd my feigned prayer on my head 
And given in earnest what I beggd in jest 
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men 
To turn their own points on their masters bosoms 
Thus Margarets curse falls heavy on my neck 
When he  quoth she  shall split thy heart with sorrow 
Remember Margaret was a prophetess  
Come  lead me  officers  to the block of shame 
Wrong hath but wrong  and blame the due of blame 

Fellows in arms  and my most loving friends 
Bruisd underneath the yoke of tyranny 
Thus far into the bowels of the land 
Have we marchd on without impediment 
And here receive we from our father Stanley 
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement 
The wretched  bloody  and usurping boar 
That spoild your summer fields and fruitful vines 
Swills your warm blood like wash  and makes his trough 
In your embowelld bosoms  this foul swine 
Is now even in the centre of this isle 
Near to the town of Leicester  as we learn 
From Tamworth thither is but one days march 
In Gods name  cheerly on  courageous friends 
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace 
By this one bloody trial of sharp war 

Every mans conscience is a thousand men 
To fight against this guilty homicide 

I doubt not but his friends will turn to us 

He hath no friends but what are friends for fear 
Which in his dearest need will fly from him 

All for our vantage  then  in Gods name  march 
True hope is swift  and flies with swallows wings 
Kings it makes gods  and meaner creatures kings 


Here pitch our tent  even here in Bosworth field 
My Lord of Surrey  why look you so sad 

My heart is ten times lighter than my looks 

My Lord of Norfolk 

Here  most gracious liege 

Norfolk  we must have knocks  ha  must we not 

We must both give and take  my loving lord 

Up with my tent  here will I lie tonight 

But where tomorrow  Well  alls one for that 
Who hath descried the number of the traitors 

Six or seven thousand is their utmost power 

Why  our battalia trebles that account 
Besides  the kings name is a tower of strength 
Which they upon the adverse faction want 
Up with the tent  Come  noble gentlemen 
Let us survey the vantage of the ground 
Call for some men of sound direction 
Lets lack no discipline  make no delay 
For  lords  tomorrow is a busy day 


The weary sun hath made a golden set 
And  by the bright track of his fiery car 
Gives token of a goodly day tomorrow 
Sir William Brandon  you shall bear my standard 
Give me some ink and paper in my tent 
Ill draw the form and model of our battle 
Limit each leader to his several charge 
And part in just proportion our small power 
My Lord of Oxford  you  Sir William Brandon 
And you  Sir Walter Herbert  stay with me 
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment 
Good Captain Blunt  bear my goodnight to him 
And by the second hour in the morning 
Desire the earl to see me in my tent 
Yet one thing more  good captain  do for me 
Where is Lord Stanley quarterd  do you know 

Unless I have mistaen his colours much 
Which  well I am assurd  I have not done 
His regiment lies half a mile at least 
South from the mighty power of the king 

If without peril it be possible 
Good Captain Blunt  bear my goodnight to him 
And give him from me this most needful note 

Upon my life  my lord  Ill undertake it 
And so  God give you quiet rest tonight 

Goodnight  good Captain Blunt  Come  gentlemen 
Let us consult upon tomorrows business 
In to my tent  the air is raw and cold 

What is t oclock 

Its suppertime  my lord 
Its nine oclock 

I will not sup tonight 
Give me some ink and paper 
What  is my beaver easier than it was 
And all my armour laid into my tent 

It is  my liege  and all things are in readiness 

Good Norfolk  hie thee to thy charge 
Use careful watch  choose trusty sentinels 

I go  my lord 

Stir with the lark tomorrow  gentle Norfolk 

I warrant you  my lord 


Ratcliff 

My lord 

Send out a pursuivant at arms 
To Stanleys regiment  bid him bring his power 
Before sunrising  lest his son George fall 
Into the blind cave of eternal night 
Fill me a bowl of wine  Give me a watch 
Saddle white Surrey for the field tomorrow 
Look that my staves be sound  and not too heavy 
Ratcliff 

My lord 

Sawst thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland 

Thomas the Earl of Surrey  and himself 
Much about cockshut time  from troop to troop 
Went through the army  cheering up the soldiers 

So  I am satisfied  Give me a bowl of wine 
I have not that alacrity of spirit 
Nor cheer of mind  that I was wont to have 
Set it down  Is ink and paper ready 

It is  my lord 

Bid my guard watch  leave me 
Ratcliff  about the mid of night come to my tent 
And help to arm me  Leave me  I say 


Fortune and victory sit on thy helm 

All comfort that the dark night can afford 
Be to thy person  noble fatherinlaw 
Tell me  how fares our loving mother 

I  by attorney  bless thee from thy mother 
Who prays continually for Richmonds good 
So much for that  The silent hours steal on 
And flaky darkness breaks within the east 
In brief  for so the season bids us be 
Prepare thy battle early in the morning 
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement 
Of bloody strokes and mortalstaring war 
I  as I may that which I would I cannot 
With best advantage will deceive the time 
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms 
But on thy side I may not be too forward 
Lest  being seen  thy brother  tender George 
Be executed in his fathers sight 
Farewell  the leisure and the fearful time 
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love 
And ample interchange of sweet discourse 
Which so long sunderd friends should dwell upon 
God give us leisure for these rites of love 
Once more  adieu  be valiant  and speed well 

Good lords  conduct him to his regiment 
Ill strive  with troubled thoughts  to take a nap 
Lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow 
When I should mount with wings of victory 
Once more  goodnight  kind lords and gentlemen 

O  thou  whose captain I account myself 
Look on my forces with a gracious eye 
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath 
That they may crush down with a heavy fall 
The usurping helmets of our adversaries 
Make us thy ministers of chastisement 
That we may praise thee in thy victory 
To thee I do commend my watchful soul 
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes 
Sleeping and waking  O  defend me still 

Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow 
Think how thou stabdst me in my prime of youth 
At Tewksbury  despair  therefore  and die 
Be cheerful  Richmond  for the wronged souls 
Of butcherd princes fight in thy behalf 
King Henrys issue  Richmond  comforts thee 


When I was mortal  my anointed body 
By thee was punched full of deadly holes 
Think on the Tower and me  despair and die 
Henry the Sixth bids thee despair and die 


Virtuous and holy  be thou conqueror 
Harry  that prophesied thou shouldst be the king 
Doth comfort thee in thy sleep  live thou and flourish 


Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow 
I  that was washd to death with fulsome wine 
Poor Clarence  by thy guile betrayd to death 
Tomorrow in the battle think on me 
And fall thy edgeless sword  despair  and die 


Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster 
The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee 
Good angels guard thy battle  live  and flourish 


Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow 
Rivers  that died at Pomfret  despair  and die 

Think upon Grey  and let thy soul despair 

Think upon Vaughan  and with guilty fear 
Let fall thy pointless lance  despair  and die 

Awake  and think our wrongs in Richards bosom 
Will conquer him  awake  and win the day 


Bloody and guilty  guiltily awake 
And in a bloody battle end thy days 
Think on Lord Hastings  so despair  and die 


Quiet  untroubled soul  awake  awake 
Arm  fight  and conquer  for fair Englands sake 


Dream on thy cousins smotherd in the Tower 
Let us be lead within thy bosom  Richard 
And weigh thee down to ruin  shame  and death 
Thy nephews souls bid thee despair  and die 


Sleep  Richmond  sleep in peace  and wake in joy 
Good angels guard thee from the boars annoy 
Live  and beget a happy race of kings 
Edwards unhappy sons do bid thee flourish 


Richard  thy wife  that wretched Anne thy wife 
That never slept a quiet hour with thee 
Now fills thy sleep with perturbations 
Tomorrow in the battle think on me 
And fall thy edgeless sword  despair  and die 


Thou quiet soul  sleep thou a quiet sleep 
Dream of success and happy victory 
Thy adversarys wife doth pray for thee 


The first was I that helpd thee to the crown 
The last was I that felt thy tyranny 
O  in the battle think on Buckingham 
And die in terror of thy guiltiness 
Dream on  dream on  of bloody deeds and death 
Fainting  despair  despairing  yield thy breath 


I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid 
But cheer thy heart  and be thou not dismayd 
God and good angels fight on Richmonds side 
And Richard falls in height of all his pride 


Give me another horse  bind up my wounds 
Have mercy  Jesu  Soft  I did but dream 
O coward conscience  how dost thou afflict me 
The lights burn blue  It is now dead midnight 
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh 
What  do I fear myself  theres none else by 
Richard loves Richard  that is  I am I 
Is there a murderer here  No  Yes  I am 
Then fly  what  from myself  Great reason why 
Lest I revenge  What  myself upon myself 
Alack  I love myself  Wherefore  for any good 
That I myself have done unto myself 
O  no  alas  I rather hate myself 
For hateful deeds committed by myself 
I am a villain  Yet I lie  I am not 
Fool  of thyself speak well  fool  do not flatter 
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues 
And every tongue brings in a several tale 
And every tale condemns me for a villain 
Perjury  perjury  in the highst degree 
Murder  stern murder  in the dirst degree 
All several sins  all usd in each degree 
Throng to the bar  crying all  Guilty  guilty  
I shall despair  There is no creature loves me 
And if I die  no soul will pity me 
Nay  wherefore should they  since that I myself 
Find in myself no pity to myself 
Methought the souls of all that I had murderd 
Came to my tent  and every one did threat 
Tomorrows vengeance on the head of Richard 


My lord 

Zounds  whos there 

Ratcliff  my lord  tis I  The early village cock 
Hath twice done salutation to the morn 
Your friends are up  and buckle on their armour 

O Ratcliff  I have dreamd a fearful dream 
What thinkest thou  will our friends prove all true 

No doubt  my lord 

O Ratcliff  I fear  I fear 

Nay  good my lord  be not afraid of shadows 

By the apostle Paul  shadows tonight 
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard 
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers 
Armed in proof  and led by shallow Richmond 
It is not yet near day  Come  go with me 
Under our tents Ill play the eavesdropper 
To hear if any mean to shrink from me 

Good morrow  Richmond 

Cry mercy  lords  and watchful gentlemen 
That you have taen a tardy sluggard here 

How have you slept  my lord 

The sweetest sleep  the fairestboding dreams 
That ever enterd in a drowsy head 
Have I since your departure had  my lords 
Methought their souls  whose bodies Richard murderd 
Came to my tent and cried on victory 
I promise you  my heart is very jocund 
In the remembrance of so fair a dream 
How far into the morning is it  lords 

Upon the stroke of four 

Why  then tis time to arm and give direction 
His oration to his Soldiers 
More than I have said  loving countrymen 
The leisure and enforcement of the time 
Forbids to dwell on  yet remember this 
God and our good cause fight upon our side 
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls 
Like highreard bulwarks  stand before our faces 
Richard except  those whom we fight against 
Had rather have us win than him they follow 
For what is he they follow  truly  gentlemen 
A bloody tyrant and a homicide 
One raisd in blood  and one in blood establishd 
One that made means to come by what he hath 
And slaughterd those that were the means to help him 
A base foul stone  made precious by the foil 
Of Englands chair  where he is falsely set 
One that hath ever been Gods enemy 
Then  if you fight against Gods enemy 
God will in justice  ward you as his soldiers 
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down 
You sleep in peace  the tyrant being slain 
If you do fight against your countrys foes 
Your countrys fat shall pay your pains the hire 
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives 
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors 
If you do free your children from the sword 
Your childrens children quit it in your age 
Then  in the name of God and all these rights 
Advance your standards  draw your willing swords 
For me  the ransom of my bold attempt 
Shall be this cold corse on the earths cold face 
But if I thrive  the gain of my attempt 
The least of your shall share his part thereof 
Sound drums and trumpets  boldly and cheerfully 
God and Saint George  Richmond and victory 

What said Northumberland as touching Richmond 

That he was never trained up in arms 

He said the truth  and what said Surrey then 

He smild  and said  The better for our purpose  

He was i the right  and so  indeed  it is 

Tell the clock there  Give me a calendar 
Who saw the sun today 

Not I  my lord 

Then he disdains to shine  for by the book 
He should have bravd the east an hour ago 
A black day will it be to somebody 
Ratcliff 

My lord 

The sun will not be seen today 
The sky doth frown and lower upon our army 
I would these dewy tears were from the ground 
Not shine today  Why  what is that to me 
More than to Richmond  for the selfsame heaven 
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him 


Arm  arm  my lord  the foe vaunts in the field 

Come  bustle  bustle  caparison my horse 
Call up Lord Stanley  bid him bring his power 
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain 
And thus my battle shall be ordered 
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length 
Consisting equally of horse and foot 
Our archers shall be placed in the midst 
John Duke of Norfolk  Thomas Earl of Surrey 
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse 
They thus directed  we will follow 
In the main battle  whose puissance on either side 
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse 
This  and Saint George to boot  What thinkst thou  Norfolk 

A good direction  warlike sovereign 
This found I on my tent this morning 


Jockey of Norfolk  be not too bold 
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold 
A thing devised by the enemy 
Go  gentlemen  every man to his charge 
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls 
Conscience is but a word that cowards use 
Devisd at first to keep the strong in awe 
Our strong arms be our conscience  swords our law 
March on  join bravely  let us to t pellmell 
If not to heaven  then hand in hand to hell 
His oration to his Army 
What shall I say more than I have inferrd 
Remember whom you are to cope withal 
A sort of vagabonds  rascals  and runaways 
A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants 
Whom their oercloyed country vomits forth 
To desperate adventures and assurd destruction 
You sleeping safe  they bring you to unrest 
You having lands  and blessd with beauteous wives 
They would restrain the one  distain the other 
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow 
Long kept in Britaine at our mothers cost 
A milksop  one that never in his life 
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow 
Lets whip these stragglers oer the sea again 
Lash hence these overweening rags of France 
These famishd beggars  weary of their lives 
Who  but for dreaming on this fond exploit 
For want of means  poor rats  had hangd themselves 
If we be conquerd  let men conquer us 
And not these bastard Bretons  whom our fathers 
Have in their own land beaten  bobbd  and thumpd 
And  on record  left them the heirs of shame 
Shall these enjoy our lands  lie with our wives 
Ravish our daughters 

Hark  I hear their drum 
Fight  gentlemen of England  fight  bold yeomen 
Draw  archers  draw your arrows to the head 
Spur your proud horses hard  and ride in blood 
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves 

What says Lord Stanley  will he bring his power 

My lord  he doth deny to come 

Off with his son Georges head 

My lord  the enemy is passd the marsh 
After the battle let George Stanley die 

A thousand hearts are great within my bosom 
Advance our standards  set upon our foes 
Our ancient word of courage  fair Saint George 
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons 
Upon them  Victory sits upon our helms 


Rescue  my Lord of Norfolk  rescue  rescue 
The king enacts more wonders than a man 
Daring an opposite to every danger 
His horse is slain  and all on foot he fights 
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death 
Rescue  fair lord  or else the day is lost 


A horse  a horse  my kingdom for a horse 

Withdraw  my lord  Ill help you to a horse 

Slave  I have set my life upon a cast 
And I will stand the hazard of the die 
I think there be six Richmonds in the field 
Five have I slain today  instead of him 
A horse  a horse  my kingdom for a horse 

God and your arms be praisd  victorious friends 
The day is ours  the bloody dog is dead 

Courageous Richmond  well hast thou acquit thee 
Lo  here  this longusurped royalty 
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch 
Have I pluckd off  to grace thy brows withal 
Wear it  enjoy it  and make much of it 

Great God of heaven  say amen to all 
But  tell me  is young George Stanley living 

He is  my lord  and safe in Leicester town 
Whither  if you please  we may withdraw us 

What men of name are slain on either side 

John Duke of Norfolk  Walter Lord Ferrers 
Sir Robert Brakenbury  and Sir William Brandon 

Inter their bodies as becomes their births 
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fied 
That in submission will return to us 
And then  as we have taen the sacrament 
We will unite the white rose and the red 
Smile  heaven  upon this fair conjunction 
That long hath frownd upon their enmity 
What traitor hears me  and says not amen 
England hath long been mad  and scarrd herself 
The brother blindly shed the brothers blood 
The father rashly slaughterd his own son 
The son  compelld  been butcher to the sire 
All this divided York and Lancaster 
Divided in their dire division 
O  now  let Richmond and Elizabeth 
The true succeeders of each royal house 
By Gods fair ordinance conjoin together 
And let their heirs God  if thy will be so 
Enrich the time to come with smoothfacd peace 
With smiling plenty  and fair prosperous days 
Abate the edge of traitors  gracious Lord 
That would reduce these bloody days again 
And make poor England weep in streams of blood 
Let them not live to taste this lands increase 
That would with treason wound this fair lands peace 
Now civil wounds are stoppd  peace lives again 
That she may long live here  God say amen
