PERICLES PRINCE OF TYRE

 
To sing a song that old was sung 
From ashes ancient Gower is come 
Assuming mans infirmities 
To glad your ear  and please your eyes 
It hath been sung at festivals 
On embereves  and holyales 
And lords and ladies in their lives 
Have read it for restoratives 
The purchase is to make men glorious 
Et bonum quo antiquius  eo melius 
If you  born in these latter times 
When wits more ripe  accept my rimes 
And that to hear an old man sing 
May to your wishes pleasure bring 
I life would wish  and that I might 
Waste it for you like taperlight 
This Antioch  then  Antiochus the Great 
Built up  this city  for his chiefest seat 
The fairest in all Syria 
I tell you what mine authors say 
This king unto him took a fere 
Who died and left a female heir 
So buxom  blithe  and full of face 
As heaven had lent her all his grace 
With whom the father liking took 
And her to incest did provoke 
Bad child  worse father  to entice his own 
To evil should be done by none 
By custom what they did begin 
Was with long use account no sin 
The beauty of this sinful dame 
Made many princes thither frame 
To seek her as a bedfellow 
In marriagepleasures playfellow 
Which to prevent  he made a law 
To keep her still  and men in awe 
That whoso askd her for his wife 
His riddle told not  lost his life 
So for her many a wight did die 
As yon grim looks do testify 
What now ensues  to the judgment of your eye 
I give  my cause who best can justify 


Young Prince of Tyre  you have at large receivd 
The danger of the task you undertake 

I have  Antiochus  and  with a soul 
Emboldend with the glory of her praise 
Think death no hazard in this enterprise 

Bring in our daughter  clothed like a bride 
For the embracements even of Jove himself 
At whose conception  till Lucina reignd 
Nature this dowry gave  to glad her presence 
The senatehouse of planets all did sit 
To knit in her their best perfections 

See  where she comes apparelld like the spring 
Graces her subjects  and her thoughts the king 
Of every virtue gives renown to men 
Her face the book of praises  where is read 
Nothing but curious pleasures  as from thence 
Sorrow were ever razd  and testy wrath 
Could never be her mild companion 
You gods  that made me man  and sway in love 
That hath inflamd desire in my breast 
To taste the fruit of you celestial tree 
Or die in the adventure  be my helps 
As I am son and servant to your will 
To compass such a boundless happiness 

Prince Pericles 

That would be son to great Antiochus 

Before thee stands this fair Hesperides 
With golden fruit  but dangerous to be touchd 
For deathlike dragons here affright thee hard 
Her face  like heaven  enticeth thee to view 
Her countless glory  which desert must gain 
And which  without desert  because thine eye 
Presumes to reach  all thy whole heap must die 
Yon sometime famous princes  like thyself 
Drawn by report  adventurous by desire 
Tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale 
That without covering  save yon field of stars 
They here stand martyrs  slain in Cupids wars 
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist 
For going on deaths net  whom none resist 

Antiochus  I thank thee  who hath taught 
My frail mortality to know itself 
And by those fearful objects to prepare 
This body  like to them  to what I must 
For death rememberd should be like a mirror 
Who tells us lifes but breath  to trust it error 
Ill make my will then  and as sick men do 
Who know the world  see heaven  but feeling woe 
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did 
So I bequeath a happy peace to you 
And all good men  as every prince should do 
My riches to the earth from whence they came 

But my unspotted fire of love to you 
Thus ready for the way of life or death 
I wait the sharpest blow 

Scorning advice  read the conclusion then 
Which read and not expounded  tis decreed 
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed 

Of all sayd yet  mayst thou prove prosperous 
Of all sayd yet  I wish thee happiness 

Like a bold champion  I assume the lists 
Nor ask advice of any other thought 
But faithfulness and courage 

I am no viper  yet I feed 
On mothers flesh which did me breed 
I sought a husband  in which labour 
I found that kindness in a father 
Hes father  son  and husband mild 
I mother  wife  and yet his child 
How they may be  and yet in two 
As you will live  resolve it you 

Sharp physic is the last  but  O you powers 
That give heaven countless eyes to view mens acts 
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually 
If this be true  which makes me pale to read it 
Fair glass of light  I lovd you  and could still 
Were not this glorious casket stord with ill 
But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt 
For hes no man on whom perfections wait 
That  knowing sin within  will touch the gate 
Youre a fair viol  and your sense the strings 
Who  fingerd to make men his lawful music 
Would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken 
But being playd upon before your time 
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime 
Good sooth  I care not for you 

Prince Pericles  touch not  upon thy life 
For thats an article within our law 
As dangerous as the rest  Your times expird 
Either expound now or receive your sentence 

Great king 
Few love to hear the sins they love to act 
Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it 
Who has a book of all that monarchs do 
Hes more secure to keep it shut than shown 
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind 
Blows dust in others eyes  to spread itself 
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear 
The breath is gone  and the sore eyes see clear 
To stop the air would hurt them  The blind mole casts 
Coppd hills towards heaven  to tell the earth is throngd 
By mans oppression  and the poor worm doth die for t 
Kings are earths gods  in vice their laws their will 
And if Jove stray  who dares say Jove doth ill 
It is enough you know  and it is fit 
What being more known grows worse  to smother it 
All love the womb that their first being bred 
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head 

Heaven  that I had thy head  he has found the meaning 
But I will gloze with him  Young Prince of Tyre 
Though by the tenour of our strict edict 
Your exposition misinterpreting 
We might proceed to cancel of your days 
Yet hope  succeeding from so fair a tree 
As your fair self  doth tune us otherwise 
Forty days longer we do respite you 
If by which time our secret be undone 
This mercy shows well joy in such a son 
And until then your entertain shall be 
As doth befit our honour and your worth 


How courtesy would seem to cover sin 
When what is done is like a hypocrite 
The which is good in nothing but in sight 
If it be true that I interpret false 
Then were it certain you were not so bad 
As with foul incest to abuse your soul 
Where now youre both a father and a son 
By your untimely claspings with your child 
Which pleasure fits a husband  not a father 
And she an eater of her mothers flesh 
By the defiling of her parents bed 
And both like serpents are  who though they feed 
On sweetest flowers  yet they poison breed 
Antioch  farewell  for wisdom sees  those men 
Blush not in actions blacker than the night 
Will shun no course to keep them from the light 
One sin  I know  another doth provoke 
Murders as near to lust as flame to smoke 
Poison and treason are the hands of sin 
Ay  and the targets  to put off the shame 
Then  lest my life be croppd to keep you clear 
By flight Ill shun the danger which I fear 

He hath found the meaning  for which we mean 
To take his head 
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy 
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin 
In such a loathed manner 
And therefore instantly this prince must die 
For by his fall my honour must keep high 
Who attends us there 


Doth your highness call 

Thaliard 
Youre of our chamber  and our mind partakes 
Her private actions to your secrecy 
And for your faithfulness we will advance you 
Thaliard  behold  heres poison  and heres gold 
We hate the Prince of Tyre  and thou must kill him 
It fits thee not to ask the reason why 
Because we bid it  Say  is it done 

My lord  tis done 

Enough 

Let your breath cool yourself  telling your haste 

My lord  Prince Pericles is fled 


As thou 
Wilt live  fly after  and  as an arrow shot 
From a wellexperiencd archer hits the mark 
His eye doth level at  so thou neer return 
Unless thou say Prince Pericles is dead  

My lord 
If I can get him within my pistols length 
Ill make him sure enough  so  farewell to your highness 

Thaliard  adieu 

Till Pericles be dead 
My heart can lend no succour to my head 


Let none disturb us 
Why should this change of thoughts 
The sad companion  dulleyd melancholy 
Be my so usd a guest  as not an hour 
In the days glorious walk or peaceful night 
The tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet 
Here pleasures court mine eyes  and mine eyes shun them 
And danger  which I feared  is at Antioch 
Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here 
Yet neither pleasures art can joy my spirits 
Nor yet the others distance comfort me 
Then it is thus  the passions of the mind 
That have their first conception by misdread 
Have afternourishment and life by care 
And what was first but fear what might be done 
Grows elder now and cares it be not done 
And so with me  the great Antiochus 
Gainst whom I am too little to contend 
Since hes so great can make his will his act 
Will think me speaking  though I swear to silence 
Nor boots it me to say I honour him 
If he suspect I may dishonour him 
And what may make him blush in being known 
Hell stop the course by which it might be known 
With hostile forces hell oerspread the land 
And with the ostent of war will look so huge 
Amazement shall drive courage from the state 
Our men be vanquishd ere they do resist 
And subjects punishd that neer thought offence 
Which care of them  not pity of myself 
Who am no more but as the tops of trees 
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them 
Make both my body pine and soul to languish 
And punish that before that he would punish 


Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast 

And keep your mind  till you return to us 
Peaceful and comfortable 

Peace  peace  and give experience tongue 
They do abuse the king that flatter him 
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin 
The thing the which is flatterd  but a spark 
To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing 
Whereas reproof  obedient and in order 
Fits kings  as they are men  for they may err 
When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace 
He flatters you  makes war upon your life 
Prince  pardon me  or strike me  if you please 
I cannot be much lower than my knees 

All leave us else  but let your cares oerlook 
What shipping and what ladings in our haven 
And then return to us 

Helicanus  thou 
Hast movd us  what seest thou in our looks 

An angry brow  dread lord 

If there be such a dart in princes frowns 
How durst thy tongue move anger to our face 

How dare the plants look up to heaven  from whence 
They have their nourishment 

Thou knowst I have power 
To take thy life from thee 

I have ground the axe myself 
Do you but strike the blow 

Rise  prithee  rise 
Sit down  thou art no flatterer 
I thank thee for it  and heaven forbid 
That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid 
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince 
Who by thy wisdom makst a prince thy servant 
What wouldst thou have me do 

To bear with patience 
Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself 

Thou speakst like a physician  Helicanus 
That ministerst a potion unto me 
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself 
Attend me then  I went to Antioch 
Where as thou knowst  against the face of death 
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty 
From whence an issue I might propagate 
Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects 
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder 
The rest  hark in thine ear  as black as incest 
Which by my knowledge found  the sinful father 
Seemd not to strike  but smooth  but thou knowst this 
Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss 
Which fear so grew in me I hither fled 
Under the covering of a careful night 
Who seemd my good protector  and  being here 
Bethought me what was past  what might succeed 
I knew him tyrannous  and tyrants fears 
Decrease not  but grow faster than the years 
And should he doubt it  as no doubt he doth 
That I should open to the listening air 
How many worthy princes bloods were shed 
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope 
To lop that doubt hell fill this land with arms 
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him 
When all  for mine  if I may call t  offence 
Must feel wars blow  who spares not innocence 
Which love to all  of which thyself art one 
Who now reprovst me for it 

Alas  sir 

Drew sleep out of mine eyes  blood from my cheeks 
Musings into my mind  with thousand doubts 
How I might stop this tempest  ere it came 
And finding little comfort to relieve them 
I thought it princely charity to grieve them 

Well  my lord  since you have given me leave to speak 
Freely will I speak  Antiochus you fear 
And justly too  I think  you fear the tyrant 
Who either by public war or private treason 
Will take away your life 
Therefore  my lord  go travel for a while 
Till that his rage and anger be forgot 
Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life 
Your rule direct to any  if to me 
Day serves not light more faithful than Ill be 

I do not doubt thy faith 
But should he wrong my liberties in my absence 

Well mingle our bloods together in the earth 
From whence we had our being and our birth 

Tyre  I now look from thee then  and to Tarsus 
Intend my travel  where Ill hear from thee 
And by whose letters Ill dispose myself 
The care I had and have of subjects good 
On thee Ill lay  whose wisdoms strength can bear it 
Ill take thy word for faith  not ask thine oath 
Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both 
But in our orbs well live so round and safe 
That time of both this truth shall neer convince 
Thou showdst a subjects shine  I a true prince 


So this is Tyre  and this the court  Here must I kill King Pericles  and if I do not  I am sure to be hanged at home  tis dangerous  Well  I perceive he was a wise fellow  and had good discretion  that  being bid to ask what he would of the king  desired he might know none of his secrets  now do I see he had some reason for it  for if a king bid a man be a villain  he is bound by the indenture of his oath to be one  Hush  here come the lords of Tyre 


You shall not need  my fellow peers of Tyre 
Further to question me of your kings departure 
His seald commission  left in trust with me 
Doth speak sufficiently hes gone to travel 

How  the king gone 

If further yet you will be satisfied 
Why  as it were unlicensd of your loves 
He would depart  Ill give some light unto you 
Being at Antioch 

What from Antioch 

Royal Antiochus on what cause I know not 
Took some displeasure at him  at least he judgd so 
And doubting lest that he had errd or sinnd 
To show his sorrow hed correct himself 
So puts himself unto the shipmans toil 
With whom each minute threatens life or death 

Well  I perceive 
I shall not be hangd now  although I would 
But since hes gone  the king it sure must please 
He scapd the land  to perish at the sea 
Ill present myself 

Peace to the lords of Tyre 

Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome 

From him I come 
With message unto princely Pericles 
But since my landing I have understood 
Your lord hath betook himself to unknown travels 
My message must return from whence it came 

We have no reason to desire it 
Commended to our master  not to us 
Yet  ere you shall depart  this we desire 
As friends to Antioch  we may feast in Tyre 


My Dionyza  shall we rest us here 
And by relating tales of others griefs 
See if twill teach us to forget our own 

That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it 
For who digs hills because they do aspire 
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher 
O my distressed lord  even such our griefs are 
Here theyre but felt  and seen with mischiefs eyes 
But like to groves  being toppd  they higher rise 

O Dionyza 
Who wanteth food  and will not say he wants it 
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish 
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep 
Our woes into the air  our eyes do weep 
Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder 
That if heaven slumber while their creatures want 
They may awake their helps to comfort them 
Ill then discourse our woes  felt several years 
And wanting breath to speak help me with tears 

Ill do my best  sir 

This Tarsus  oer which I have the government 
A city on whom plenty held full hand 
For riches strewd herself even in the streets 
Whose towers bore heads so high they kissd the clouds 
And strangers neer beheld but wonderd at 
Whose men and dames so jetted and adornd 
Like one anothers glass to trim them by 
Their tables were stord full to glad the sight 
And not so much to feed on as delight 
All poverty was scornd  and pride so great 
The name of help grew odious to repeat 

O  tis too true 

But see what heaven can do  By this our change 
These mouths  whom but of late earth  sea  and air 
Were all too little to content and please 
Although they gave their creatures in abundance 
As houses are defild for want of use 
They are now starvd for want of exercise 
Those palates who  not yet two summers younger 
Must have inventions to delight the taste 
Would now be glad of bread  and beg for it 
Those mothers who  to nousle up their babes 
Thought nought too curious  are ready now 
To eat those little darlings whom they lovd 
So sharp are hungers teeth  that man and wife 
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life 
Here stands a lord  and there a lady weeping 
Here many sink  yet those which see them fall 
Have scarce strength left to give them burial 
Is not this true 

Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it 

O  let those cities that of plentys cup 
And her prosperities so largely taste 
With their superfluous riots  hear these tears 
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs 


Wheres the lord governor 

Here 
Speak out thy sorrows which thou bringst in haste 
For comfort is too far for us to expect 

We have descried  upon our neighbouring shore 
A portly sail of ships make hitherward 

I thought as much 
One sorrow never comes but brings an heir 
That may succeed as his inberitor 
And so in ours  Some neighbouring nation 
Taking advantage of our misery 
Hath stuffd these hollow vessels with their power 
To beat us down  the which are down already 
And make a conquest of unhappy me 
Whereas no glorys got to overcome 

Thats the least fear  for by the semblance 
Of their white flags displayd  they bring us peace 
And come to us as favourers  not as foes 

Thou speakst like him s untutord to repeat 
Who makes the fairest show means most deceit 
But bring they what they will and what they can 
What need we fear 
The grounds the lowest and we are half way there 
Go tell their general we attend him here 
To know for what he comes  and whence he comes 
And what he craves 

I go  my lord 


Welcome is peace if he on peace consist 
If wars we are unable to resist 


Lord governor  for so we hear you are 
Let not our ships and number of our men 
Be like a beacon fird to amaze your eyes 
We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre 
And seen the desolation of your streets 
Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears 
But to relieve them of their heavy load 
And these our ships  you happily may think 
Are like the Trojan horse was stuffd within 
With bloody veins  expecting overthrow 
Are stord with corn to make your needy bread 
And give them life whom hunger starvd half dead 

The gods of Greece protect you 
And well pray for you 

Arise  I pray you  rise 
We do not look for reverence  but for love 
And harbourage for ourself  our ships  and men 

The which when any shall not gratify 
Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought 
Be it our wives  our children  or ourselves 
The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils 
Till when the which  I hope  shall neer be seen 
Your Grace is welcome to our town and us 

Which welcome well accept  feast here awhile 
Until our stars that frown lend us a smile 

Here have you seen a mighty king 
His child  I wis  to incest bring 
A better prince and benign lord 
That will prove awful both in deed and word 
Be quiet  then  as men should be 
Till he hath passd necessity 
Ill show you those in troubles reign 
Losing a mite  a mountain gain 
The good in conversation 
To whom I give my benison 
Is still at Tarsus  where each man 
Thinks all is writ he speken can 
And  to remember what he does 
Build his statue to make him glorious 
But tidings to the contrary 
Are brought your eyes  what need speak I 


Good Helicane hath stayd at home 
Not to eat honey like a drone 
From others labours  for though he strive 
To killen bad  keep good alive 
And to fulfil his prince desire 
Sends word of all that haps in Tyre 
How Thaliard came full bent with sin 
And had intent to murder him 
And that in Tarsus was not best 
Longer for him to make his rest 
He  doing so  put forth to seas 
Where when men been  theres seldom ease 
For now the wind begins to blow 
Thunder above and deeps below 
Make such unquiet  that the ship 
Should house him safe is wrackd and split 
And he  good prince  having all lost 
By waves from coast to coast is tost 
All perishen of man  of pelf 
Ne aught escapen but himself 
Till Fortune  tird with doing bad 
Threw him ashore  to give him glad 
And here he comes  What shall be next 
Pardon old Gower  this longs the text 

Yet cease your ire  you angry stars of heaven 
Wind  rain  and thunder  remember  earthly man 
Is but a substance that must yield to you 
And I  as fits my nature  do obey you 
Alas  the sea hath cast me on the rocks 
Washd me from shore to shore  and left me breath 
Nothing to think on but ensuing death 
Let it suffice the greatness of your powers 
To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes 
And having thrown him from your watery grave 
Here to have death in peace is all hell crave 


What  ho  Pilch 

Ha  come and bring away the nets 

What  Patchbreech  I say 

What say you  master 

Look how thou stirrest now  come away  or Ill fetch thee with a wannion 

Faith  master  I am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before us even now 

Alas  poor souls  it grieved my heart to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help them  when  welladay  we could scarce help ourselves 

Nay  master  said not I as much when I saw the porpus how he bounced and tumbled  they say theyre half fish half flesh  a plague on them  they neer come but I look to be washed  Master  I marvel how the fishes live in the sea 

Why  as men do aland  the great ones eat up the little ones  I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale  a plays and tumbles  driving the poor fry before him  and at last devours them all at a mouthful  Such whales have I heard on o the land  who never leave gaping till theyve swallowed the whole parish  church  steeple  bells  and all 

A pretty moral 

But master  if I had been the sexton  I would have been that day in the belfry 

Why  man 

Because he should have swallowed me too  and when I had been in his belly  I would have kept such a jangling of the bells  that he should never have left till he cast bells  steeple  church  and parish  up again  But if the good King Simonides were of my mind 

Simonides 

We would purge the land of these drones  that rob the bee of her honey 

How from the finny subject of the sea 
These fishers tell the infirmities of men 
And from their watery empire recollect 
All that may men approve or men detect 


Peace be at your labour  honest fishermen 

Honest  good fellow  whats that  if it be a day fits you  search out of the calendar  and nobody look after it 

Y may see the sea hath cast me on your coast 

What a drunken knave was the sea  to cast thee in our way 

A man whom both the waters and the wind 
In that vast tenniscourt  have made the ball 
For them to play upon  entreats you pity him 
He asks of you  that never usd to beg 

No  friend  cannot you beg  heres them in our country of Greece gets more with begging than we can do with working 

Canst thou catch any fishes then 

I never practised it 

Nay then thou wilt starve  sure  for heres nothing to be got nowadays unless thou canst fish for t 

What I have been I have forgot to know 
But what I am want teaches me to think on 
A man throngd up with cold  my veins are chill 
And have no more of life than may suffice 
To give my tongue that heat to ask your help 
Which if you shall refuse  when I am dead 
For that I am a man  pray see me buried 

Die  quotha  Now  gods forbid  I have a gown here  come  put it on  keep thee warm  Now  afore me  a handsome fellow  Come  thou shalt go home  and well have flesh for holidays  fish for fastingdays  and moreoer puddings and flapjacks  and thou shalt be welcome 

I thank you  sir 

Hark you  my friend  you said you could not beg 

I did but crave 

But crave  Then Ill turn craver too  and so I shall scape whipping 

Why  are all your beggars whipped  then 

O  not all  my friend  not all  for if all your beggars were whipped  I would wish no better office than to be beadle  But  master  Ill go draw up the net 


How well this honest mirth becomes their labour 

Hark you  sir  do you know where ye are 

Not well 

Why  Ill tell you  this is called Pentapolis  and our king the good Simonides 

The good King Simonides do you call him 

Ay  sir  and he deserves to be so called for his peaceable reign and good government 

He is a happy king  since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government  How far is his court distant from this shore 

Marry  sir  half a days journey  and Ill tell you  he hath a fair daughter  and tomorrow is her birthday  and there are princes and knights come from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love 

Were my fortunes equal to my desires  I could wish to make one there 

O  sir  things must be as they may  and what a man cannot get  he may lawfully deal for his wifes soul 


Help  master  help  heres a fish hangs in the net  like a poor mans right in the law  twill hardly come out  Ha  bots on t  tis come at last  and tis turned to a rusty armour 

An armour  friends  I pray you  let me see it 
Thanks  Fortune  yet  that after all my crosses 
Thou givst me somewhat to repair myself 
And though it was mine own  part of mine heritage 
Which my dead father did bequeath to me 
With this strict charge  even as he left his life 
Keep it  my Pericles  it hath been a shield 
Twixt me and death  and pointed to this brace 
For that it savd me  keep it  in like necessity 
The which the gods protect thee from t may defend thee  
It kept where I kept  I so dearly lovd it 
Till the rough seas  that spare not any man 
Took it in rage  though calmd they have given t again 
I thank thee for t  my shipwrack now s no ill 
Since I have here my fathers gift in s will 

What mean you  sir 

To beg of you  kind friends  this coat of worth 
For it was sometime target to a king 
I know it by this mark  He lovd me dearly 
And for his sake I wish the having of it 
And that youd guide me to your sovereigns court 
Where with it I may appear a gentleman 
And if that ever my low fortunes better 
Ill pay your bounties  till then rest your debtor 

Why  wilt thou tourney for the lady 

Ill show the virtue I have borne in arms 

Why  doe take it  and the gods give thee good on t 

Ay  but hark you  my friend  twas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the water  there are certain condolements  certain vails  I hope  sir  if you thrive  youll remember from whence you had it 

Believe it  I will 
By your furtherance I am clothd in steel 
And spite of all the rapture of the sea 
This jewel holds his biding on my arm 
Unto thy value will I mount myself 
Upon a courser  whose delightful steps 
Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread 
Only  my friend  I yet am unprovided 
Of a pair of bases 

Well sure provide  thou shalt have my best gown to make thee a pair  and Ill bring thee to the court myself 

Then honour be but a goal to my will  This day Ill rise  or else add ill to ill 

Are the knights ready to begin the triumph 

They are  my liege 
And stay your coming to present themselves 

Return them  we are ready  and our daughter 
In honour of whose birth these triumphs are 
Sits here  like beautys child  whom nature gat 
For men to see  and seeing wonder at 


It pleaseth you  my royal father  to express 
My commendations great  whose merits less 

Tis fit it should be so  for princes are 
A model  which heaven makes like to itself 
As jewels lose their glory if neglected 
So princes their renowns if not respected 
Tis now your honour  daughter  to explain 
The labour of each knight in his device 

Which  to preserve mine honour  Ill perform 


Who is the first that doth prefer himself 

A knight of Sparta  my renowned father 
And the device he bears upon his shield 
Is a black Ethiop reaching at the sun 
The word  Lux tua vita mihi 

He loves you well that holds his life of you 

Who is the second that presents himself 

A prince of Macedon  my royal father 
And the device he bears upon his shield 
Is an armd knight thats conquerd by a lady 
The motto thus  in Spanish  Piu por dulzura que por fuerza 


And whats the third 

The third of Antioch 
And his device  a wreath of chivalry 
The word  Me pomp  provexit apex 


What is the fourth 

A burning torch thats turned upside down 
The word  Quod me alit me extinguit 

Which shows that beauty hath his power and will 
Which can as well inflame as it can kill 


The fifth  a hand environed with clouds 
Holding out gold thats by the touchstone tried 
The motto thus  Sic spectanda fides 


And what s 
The sixth and last  the which the knight himself 
With such a graceful courtesy deliverd 

He seems to be a stranger  but his present is 
A witherd branch  thats only green at top 
The motto  In hac spe vivo 

A pretty moral 
From the dejected state wherein he is 
He hopes by you his fortune yet may flourish 

He had need mean better than his outward show 
Can any way speak in his just commend 
For  by his rusty outside he appears 
To have practisd more the whipstock than the lance 

He well may be a stranger  for he comes 
To an honourd triumph strangely furnished 

And on set purpose let his armour rust 
Until this day  to scour it in the dust 

Opinions but a fool  that makes us scan 
The outward habit by the inward man 
But stay  the knights are coming  well withdraw 
Into the gallery 


Knights 
To say youre welcome were superfluous 
To place upon the volume of your deeds 
As in a titlepage  your worth in arms 
Were more than you expect  or more thans fit 
Since every worth in show commends itself 
Prepare for mirth  for mirth becomes a feast 
You are princes and my guests 

But you  my knight and guest 
To whom this wreath of victory I give 
And crown you king of this days happiness 

Tis more by fortune  lady  than by merit 

Call it by what you will  the day is yours 
And here  I hope  is none that envies it 
In framing an artist art hath thus decreed 
To make some good  but others to exceed 
And youre her labourd scholar  Come  queen o the feast 
For  daughter  so you are here take your place 
Marshal the rest  as they deserve their grace 

We are honourd much by good Simonides 

Your presence glads our days  honour we love 
For who hates honour  hates the gods above 

Sir  yonder is your place 

Some other is more fit 

Contend not  sir  for we are gentlemen 
That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes 
Envy the great nor do the low despise 

You are right courteous knights 

Sit  sir  sit 

By Jove  I wonder  that is king of thoughts 
These cates resist me  she but thought upon 

By Juno  that is queen of marriage 
All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury 
Wishing him my meat  Sure  hes a gallant gentleman 

Hes but a country gentleman 
He has done no more than other knights have done 
He has broken a staff or so  so let it pass 

To me he seems like diamond to glass 

Yon kings to me like to my fathers picture 
Which tells me in that glory once he was 
Had princes sit  like stars  about his throne 
And he the sun for them to reverence 
None that beheld him  but like lesser lights 
Did vail their crowns to his supremacy 
Where now his sons like a glowworm in the night 
The which hath fire in darkness  none in light 
Whereby I see that Times the king of men 
Hes both their parent  and he is their grave 
And gives them what he will  not what they crave 

What  are you merry  knights 

Who can be other in this royal presence 

Here  with a cup thats stord unto the brim 
As you do love  fill to your mistress lips 
We drink this health to you 

We thank your Grace 

Yet pause awhile 
Yon knight doth sit too melancholy 
As if the entertainment in our court 
Had not a show might countervail his worth 
Note it not you  Thaisa 

What is it 
To me  my father 

O  attend  my daughter 
Princes in this should live like gods above 
Who freely give to every one that comes 
To honour them 
And princes not doing so are like to gnats 
Which make a sound  but killd are wonderd at 
Therefore to make his entrance more sweet 
Here say we drink this standingbowl of wine to him 

Alas  my father  it befits not me 
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold 
He may my proffer take for an offence 
Since men take womens gifts for impudence 

How 
Do as I bid you  or youll move me else 

Now  by the gods  he could not please me better 

And further tell him  we desire to know of him 
Of whence he is  his name  and parentage 

The king  my father  sir  has drunk to you 

I thank him 

Wishing it so much blood unto your life 

I thank both him and you  and pledge him freely 

And further he desires to know of you 
Of whence you are  your name and parentage 

A gentleman of Tyre  my name  Pericles 
My education been in arts and arms 
Who  looking for adventures in the world 
Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men 
And after shipwrack  driven upon this shore 

He thanks your Grace  names himself Pericles 
A gentleman of Tyre 
Who only by misfortune of the seas 
Bereft of ships and men  cast on this shore 

Now  by the gods  I pity his misfortune 
And will awake him from his melancholy 
Come  gentlemen  we sit too long on trifles 
And waste the time which looks for other revels 
Even in your armours  as you are addressd 
Will very well become a soldiers dance 
I will not have excuse  with saying this 
Loud music is too harsh for ladies heads 
Since they love men in arms as well as beds 

So this was well askd  twas so well performd 
Come  sir 
Here is a lady that wants breathing too 
And I have often heard  you knights of Tyre 
Are excellent in making ladies trip 
And that their measures are as excellent 

In those that practise them they are  my lord 

O  thats as much as you would be denied 
Of your fair courtesy 

Unclasp  unclasp 
Thanks  gentlemen  to all  all have done well 


But you the best  Pages and lights  to conduct 
These knights unto their several lodgings  Yours  sir 
We have given order to be next our own 

I am at your Graces pleasure 

Princes  it is too late to talk of love 
And thats the mark I know you level at 
Therefore each one betake him to his rest 
Tomorrow all for speeding do their best 


No  Escanes  know this of me 
Antiochus from incest livd not free 
For which  the most high gods not minding longer 
To withhold the vengeance that they had in store 
Due to this heinous capital offence 
Even in the height and pride of all his glory 
When he was seated in a chariot 
Of an inestimable value  and his daughter with him 
A fire from heaven came and shrivelld up 
Their bodies  even to loathing  for they so stunk 
That all those eyes adord them ere their fall 
Scorn now their hand should give them burial 

Twas very strange 

And yet but just  for though 
This king were great  his greatness was no guard 
To bar heavens shaft  but sin had his reward 

Tis very true 


See  not a man in private conference 
Or council has respect with him but he 

It shall no longer grieve without reproof 

And cursd be he that will not second it 

Follow me then  Lord Helicane  a word 

With me  and welcome  Happy day  my lords 

Know that our griefs are risen to the top 
And now at length they overflow their banks 

Your griefs  for what  wrong not the prince you love 

Wrong not yourself then  noble Helicane 
But if the prince do live  let us salute him 
Or know what grounds made happy by his breath 
If in the world he live  well seek him out 
If in his grave he rest  well find him there 
And be resolvd he lives to govern us 
Or dead  give s cause to mourn his funeral 
And leaves us to our free election 

Whose deaths indeed the strongest in our censure 
And knowing this kingdom is without a head 
Like goodly buildings left without a roof 
Soon fall to ruin  your noble self 
That best knowst how to rule and how to reign 
We thus submit unto  our sovereign 

Live  noble Helicane 

For honours cause forbear your suffrages 
If that you love Prince Pericles  forbear 
Take I your wish  I leap into the seas 
Wheres hourly trouble for a minutes ease 
A twelvemonth longer  let me entreat you 
To forbear the absence of your king 
If in which time expird he not return 
I shall with aged patience bear your yoke 
But if I cannot win you to this love 
Go search like nobles  like noble subjects 
And in your search spend your adventurous worth 
Whom if you find  and win unto return 
You shall like diamonds sit about his crown 

To wisdom hes a fool that will not yield 
And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us 
We with our travels will endeavour it 

Then you love us  we you  and well clasp hands 
When peers thus knit  a kingdom ever stands 


Good morrow to the good Simonides 

Knights  from my daughter this I let you know 
That for this twelvemonth shell not undertake 
A married life 
Her reason to herself is only known 
Which yet from her by no means can I get 

May we not get access to her  my lord 

Faith  by no means  she hath so strictly tied 
Her to her chamber that tis impossible 
One twelve moons more shell wear Dianas livery 
This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowd 
And on her virgin honour will not break it 

Though loath to bid farewell  we take our leaves 


So 
Theyre well dispatchd  now to my daughters letter 
She tells me here  shell wed the stranger knight 
Or never more to view nor day nor light 
Tis well  mistress  your choice agrees with mine 
I like that well  how absolute shes in t 
Not minding whether I dislike or no 
Well  I do commend her choice 
And will no longer have it be delayd 
Soft  here he comes  I must dissemble it 


All fortune to the good Simonides 

To you as much  sir  I am beholding to you 
For your sweet music this last night  I do 
Protest my ears were never better fed 
With such delightful pleasing harmony 

It is your Graces pleasure to commend 
Not my desert 

Sir  you are musics master 

The worst of all her scholars  my good lord 

Let me ask you one thing 
What do you think of my daughter  sir 

A most virtuous princess 

And she is fair too  is she not 

As a fair day in summer  wondrous fair 

My daughter  sir  thinks very well of you 
Ay  so well  that you must be her master 
And she will be your scholar  therefore look to it 

I am unworthy for her schoolmaster 

She thinks not so  peruse this writing else 

Whats here 
A letter that she loves the knight of Tyre 
Tis the kings subtilty to have my life 
O  seek not to entrap me  gracious lord 
A stranger and distressed gentleman 
That never aimd so high to love your daughter 
But bent all offices to honour her 

Thou hast bewitchd my daughter  and thou art 
A villain 

By the gods  I have not 
Never did thought of mine levy offence 
Nor never did my actions yet commence 
A deed might gain her love or your displeasure 

Traitor  thou liest 

Traitor 

Ay  traitor 

Even in his throat  unless it be the king 
That calls me traitor  I return the lie 

Now  by the gods  I do applaud his courage 

My actions are as noble as my thoughts 
That never relishd of a base descent 
I came unto your court for honours cause 
And not to be a rebel to her state 
And he that otherwise accounts of me 
This sword shall prove hes honours enemy 

No 
Here comes my daughter  she can witness it 


Then  as you are as virtuous as fair 
Resolve your angry father  if my tongue 
Did eer solicit  or my hand subscribe 
To any syllable that made love to you 

Why  sir  say if you had 
Who takes offence at that would make me glad 

Yea  mistress  are you so peremptory 


I am glad on t  with all my heart 
Ill tame you  Ill bring you in subjection 
Will you  not having my consent 
Bestow your love and your affections 
Upon a stranger 

who  for aught I know 
May be  nor can I think the contrary 
As great in blood as I myself 


Therefore  hear you  mistress  either frame 
Your will to mine  and you  sir  hear you 
Either be ruld by me  or I will make you 
Man and wife 
Nay  come  your hands and lips must seal it too 
And being joind  Ill thus your hopes destroy 
And for a further grief God give you joy 
What  are you both pleasd 

Yes  if you love me  sir 

Even as my life  or blood that fosters it 

What  are you both agreed 

Yes  if t please your majesty 

Yes  if t please your majesty 

It pleaseth me so well  that I will see you wed 
Then with what haste you can get you to bed 

Now sleep yslaked hath the rout 
No din but snores the house about 
Made louder by the oerfed breast 
Of this most pompous marriagefeast 
The cat  with eyne of burning coal 
Now couches fore the mouses hole 
And crickets sing at the ovens mouth 
Eer the blither for their drouth 
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed 
Where  by the loss of maidenhead 
A babe is moulded  Be attent 
And time that is so briefly spent 
With your fine fancies quaintly eche 
Whats dumb in show Ill plain with speech 


By many a dern and painful perch 
Of Pericles the careful search 
By the four opposing coigns 
Which the world together joins 
Is made with all due diligence 
That horse and sail and high expense 
Can stead the quest  At last from Tyre 
Fame answering the most strange inquire 
To the court of King Simonides 
Are letters brought  the tenour these 
Antiochus and his daughter dead 
The men of Tyrus on the head 
Of Helicanus would set on 
The crown of Tyre  but he will none 
The mutiny he there hastes t oppress 
Says to em  if King Pericles 
Come not home in twice six moons 
He  obedient to their dooms 
Will take the crown  The sum of this 
Brought hither to Pentapolis 
Yravished the regions round 
And every one with claps can sound 
Our heirapparent is a king 
Who dreamd  who thought of such a thing  
Brief  he must hence depart to Tyre 
His queen  with child  makes her desire 
Which who shall cross along to go 
Omit we all their dole and woe 
Lychorida  her nurse  she takes 
And so to sea  Their vessel shakes 
On Neptunes billow  half the flood 
Hath their keel cut  but Fortunes mood 
Varies again  the grisled north 
Disgorges such a tempest forth 
That  as a duck for life that dives 
So up and down the poor ship drives 
The lady shrieks  and wellanear 
Does fall in travail with her fear 
And what ensues in this fell storm 
Shall for itself itself perform 
I nill relate  action may 
Conveniently the rest convey 
Which might not what by me is told 
In your imagination hold 
This stage the ship  upon whose deck 
The seatost Pericles appears to speak 

Thou God of this great vast  rebuke these surges 
Which wash both heaven and hell  and thou  that hast 
Upon the winds command  bind them in brass 
Having calld them from the deep  O  still 
Thy deafening  dreadful thunders  gently quench 
Thy nimble  sulphurous flashes  O  how Lychorida 
How does my queen  Thou stormest venomously 
Wilt thou spit all thyself  The seamans whistle 
Is as a whisper in the ears of death 
Unheard  Lychorida  Lucina  O 
Divinest patroness  and midwife gentle 
To those that cry by night  convey thy deity 
Aboard our dancing boat  make swift the pangs 
Of my queens travails 

Now  Lychorida 

Here is a thing too young for such a place 
Who  if it had conceit  would die  as I 
Am like to do  take in your arms this piece 
Of your dead queen 

How  how  Lychorida 

Patience  good sir  do not assist the storm 
Heres all that is left living of your queen 
A little daughter  for the sake of it 
Be manly  and take comfort 

O you gods 
Why do you make us love your goodly gifts 
And snatch them straight away  We here below 
Recall not what we give  and therein may 
Use honour with you 

Patience  good sir 
Even for this charge 

Now  mild may be thy life 
For a more blustrous birth had never babe 
Quiet and gentle thy conditions 
For thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world 
That eer was princes child  Happy what follows 
Thou hast as chiding a nativity 
As fire  air  water  earth  and heaven can make 
To herald thee from the womb  even at the first 
Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit 
With all thou canst find here  Now  the good gods 
Throw their best eyes upon t 


What courage  sir  God save you 

Courage enough  I do not fear the flaw 
It hath done to me the worst  Yet for the love 
Of this poor infant  this freshnew seafarer 
I would it would be quiet 

Slack the bolins there  thou wilt not  wilt thou  Blow  and split thyself 

But searoom  an the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon  I care not 

Sir  you queen must overboard  the sea works high  the wind is loud  and will not lie till the ship be cleared of the dead 

Thats your superstition 

Pardon us  sir  with us at sea it hath been still observed  and we are strong in custom  Therefore briefly yield her  for she must overboard straight 

As you think meet  Most wretched queen 

Here she lies  sir 

A terrible childbed hast thou had  my dear 
No light  no fire  the unfriendly elements 
Forgot thee utterly  nor have I time 
To give thee hallowd to thy grave  but straight 
Must cast thee  scarcely coffind  in the ooze 
Where  for a monument upon thy bones 
And ayeremaining lamps  the belching whale 
And humming water must oerwhelm thy corpse 
Lying with simple shells  O Lychorida 
Bid Nestor bring me spices  ink and paper 
My casket and my jewels  and bid Nicander 
Bring me the satin coffer  lay the babe 
Upon the pillow  Hie thee  whiles I say 
A priestly farewell to her  suddenly  woman 


Sir  we have a chest beneath the hatches  caulkd and bitumed ready 

I thank thee  Mariner  say what coast is this 

We are near Tarsus 

Thither  gentle mariner 
Alter thy course for Tyre  When canst thou reach it 

By break of day  if the wind cease 

O  make for Tarsus 
There will I visit Cleon  for the babe 
Cannot hold out to Tyrus  there Ill leave it 
At careful nursing  Go thy ways  good mariner 
Ill bring the body presently 


Philemon  ho 


Doth my lord call 

Get fire and meat for these poor men 
T has been a turbulent and stormy night 

I have been in many  but such a night as this 
Till now I neer endurd 

Your master will be dead ere you return 
Theres nothing can be ministerd to nature 
That can recover him 

Give this to the pothecary 
And tell me how it works 

Good morrow  sir 

Good morrow to your lordship 

Gentlemen 
Why do you stir so early 

Sir 
Our lodgings  standing bleak upon the sea 
Shook as the earth did quake 
The very principals did seem to rend 
And all to topple  Pure surprise and fear 
Made me to quit the house 

That is the cause we trouble you so early 
Tis not our husbandry 

O  you say well 

But I much marvel that your lordship  having 
Rich tire about you  should at these early hours 
Shake off the golden slumber of repose 
Tis most strange 
Nature should be so conversant with pain 
Being thereto not compelld 

I hold it ever 
Virtue and cunning were endowments greater 
Than nobleness and riches  careless heirs 
May the two latter darken and expend 
But immortality attends the former 
Making a man a god  Tis known I ever 
Have studied physic  through which secret art 
By turning oer authorities  I have 
Together with my practice made familiar 
To me and to my aid the blest infusions 
That dwell in vegetives  in metals  stones 
And can speak of the disturbances 
That nature works  and of her cures  which doth give me 
A more content in course of true delight 
Than to be thirsty after tottering honour 
Or tie my treasure up in silken bags 
To please the fool and death 

Your honour has through Ephesus pourd forth 
Your charity  and hundreds call themselves 
Your creatures  who by you have been restord 
And not your knowledge  your personal pain  but even 
Your purse  still open  hath built Lord Cerimon 
Such strong renown as time shall neer decay 


So  lift there 

What is that 

Sir  even now 
Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest 
Tis of some wrack 

Set it down  lets look upon t 

Tis like a coffin  sir 

Whateer it be 
Tis wondrous heavy  Wrench it open straight 
If the seas stomach be oerchargd with gold 
Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us 

Tis so  my lord 

How close tis caulkd and bitumed 
Did the sea cast it up 

I never saw so huge a billow  sir 
As tossd it upon shore 

Come  wrench it open 
Soft  it smells most sweetly in my sense 

A delicate odour 

As ever hit my nostril  So  up with it 
O you most potent gods  whats here  a corse 

Most strange 

Shrouded in cloth of state  balmd and entreasurd 
With full bags of spices  A passport too 
Apollo  perfect me i the characters 

Here I give to understand 
If eer this coffin drive aland 
I  King Pericles  have lost 
This queen worth all our mundane cost 
Who finds her  give her burying 
She was the daughter of a king 
Besides this treasure for a fee 
The gods requite his charity 

If thou livst  Pericles  thou hast a heart 
That even cracks for woe  This chancd tonight 

Most likely  sir 

Nay  certainly tonight 
For look  how fresh she looks  They were too rough 
That threw her in the sea  Make fire within 
Fetch hither all the boxes in my closet 

Death may usurp on nature many hours 
And yet the fire of life kindle again 
The overpressd spirits  I heard 
Of an Egyptian  that had nine hours lien dead 
Who was by good appliances recovered 


Well said  well said  the fire and cloths 
The rough and woeful music that we have 
Cause it to sound  beseech you 
The viol once more how thou stirrst  thou block 
The music there  I pray you  give her air 
Gentlemen 
This queen will live  nature awakes  a warmth 
Breathes out of her  she hath not been entrancd 
Above five hours  See  how she gins to blow 

Into lifes flower again 

The heavens 
Through you increase our wonder and set up 
Your fame for ever 

She is alive  behold 
Her eyelids  cases to those heavenly jewels 
Which Pericles hath lost 
Begin to part their fringes of bright gold 
The diamonds of a most praised water 
Do appear  to make the world twice rich  Live 
And make us weep to hear your fate  fair creature 
Rare as you seem to be 


O dear Diana 
Where am I  Wheres my lord  What world is this 

Is not this strange 

Most rare 

Hush  gentle neighbours 
Lend me your hands  to the next chamber bear her 
Get linen  now this matter must be lookd to 
For her relapse is mortal  Come  come 
And  sculapius guide us 


Most honourd Cleon  I must needs be gone 
My twelve months are expird  and Tyrus stands 
In a litigious peace  You and your lady 
Take from my heart all thankfulness  the gods 
Make up the rest upon you 

Your shafts of fortune  though they hurt you mortally 
Yet glance full wanderingly on us 

O your sweet queen 
That the strict fates had pleasd you had brought her hither 
To have blessd mine eyes with her 

We cannot but obey 
The powers above us  Could I rage and roar 
As doth the sea she lies in  yet the end 
Must be as tis  My gentle babe Marina whom 
For she was born at sea  I have namd so here 
I charge your charity withal  and leave her 
The infant of your care  beseeching you 
To give her princely training  that she may be 
Mannerd as she is born 

Fear not  my lord  but think 
Your Grace  that fed my country with your corn 
For which the peoples prayers still fall upon you 
Must in your child be thought on  If neglection 
Should therein make me vile  the common body 
By you relievd  would force me to my duty 
But if to that my nature need a spur 
The gods revenge it upon me and mine 
To the end of generation 

I believe you 
Your honour and your goodness teach me to t 
Without your vows  Till she be married  madam 
By bright Diana  whom we honour  all 
Unscissard shall this hair of mine remain 
Though I show ill in t  So I take my leave 
Good madam  make me blessed in your care 
In bringing up my child 

I have one myself 
Who shall not be more dear to my respect 
Than yours  my lord 

Madam  my thanks and prayers 

Well bring your Grace een to the edge o the shore 
Then give you up to the maskd Neptune and 
The gentlest winds of heaven 

I will embrace 
Your offer  Come  dearest madam  O  no tears 
Lychorida  no tears 
Look to your little mistress  on whose grace 
You may depend hereafter  Come  my lord 


Madam  this letter  and some certain jewels 
Lay with you in your coffer  which are now 
At your command  Know you the character 

It is my lords 
That I was shippd at sea  I well remember 
Even on my eaning time  but whether there 
Deliverd  by the holy gods 
I cannot rightly say  But since King Pericles 
My wedded lord  I neer shall see again 
A vestal livery will I take me to 
And never more have joy 

Madam  if this you purpose as you speak 
Dianas temple is not distant far 
Where you may abide till your date expire 
Moreover  if you please  a niece of mine 
Shall there attend you 

My recompense is thanks  thats all 
Yet my good will is great  though the gift small 

Imagine Pericles arrivd at Tyre 
Welcomd and settled to his own desire 
His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus 
Unto Diana there a votaress 
Now to Marina bend your mind 
Whom our fastgrowing scene must find 
At Tarsus  and by Cleon traind 
In music  letters  who hath gaind 
Of education all the grace 
Which makes her bath the heart and places 
Of general wonder  But  alack 
That monster envy  oft the wrack 
Of earned praise  Marinas life 
Seeks to take off by treasons knife 
And in this kind hath our Cleon 
One daughter  and a wench full grown 
Even ripe for marriagerite  this maid 
Hight Philoten  and it is said 
For certain in our story  she 
Would ever with Marina be 
Be t when she weavd the sleided silk 
With fingers  long  small  white as milk 
Or when she would with sharp neeld wound 
The cambric  which she made more sound 
By hurting it  when to the lute 
She sung  and made the nightbird mute 
That still records with moan  or when 
She would with rich and constant pen 
Vail to her mistress Dian  still 
This Philoten contends in skill 
With absolute Marina  so 
With the dove of Paphos might the crow 
Vie feathers white  Marina gets 
All praises  which are paid as debts 
And not as given  This so darks 
In Philoten all graceful marks 
That Cleons wife  with envy rare 
A present murderer does prepare 
For good Marina  that her daughter 
Might stand peerless by this slaughter 
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead 
Lychorida  our nurse  is dead 
And cursed Dionyza hath 
The pregnant instrument of wrath 
Prest for this blow  The unborn event 
I do commend to your content 
Only I carry winged time 
Post on the lame feet of my rime 
Which never could I so convey 
Unless your thoughts went on my way 
Dionyza doth appear 
With Leonine  a murderer 


Thy oath remember  thou hast sworn to do t 
Tis but a blow  which never shall be known 
Thou canst not do a thing i the world so soon 
To yield thee so much profit  Let not conscience 
Which is but cold  inflaming love i thy bosom 
Inflame too nicely  nor let pity  which 
Even women have cast off  melt thee  but he 
A soldier to thy purpose 

Ill do t  but yet she is a goodly creature 

The fitter  then  the gods should have her  Here 
She comes weeping for her only mistress death 
Thou art resolvd 

I am resolvd 


No  I will rob Tellus of her weed 
To strew thy green with flowers  the yellows  blues 
The purple violets  and marigolds 
Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave 
While summer days do last  Ay me  poor maid 
Born in a tempest  when my mother died 
This world to me is like a lasting storm 
Whirring me from my friends 

How now  Marina  why do you keep alone 
How chance my daughter is not with you  Do not 
Consume your blood with sorrowing  you have 
A nurse of me  Lord  how your favours changd 
With this unprofitable woe  Come 
Give me your flowers  ere the sea mar it 
Walk with Leonine  the air is quick there 
And it pierces and sharpens the stomach  Come 
Leonine  take her by the arm  walk with her 

No  I pray you 
Ill not bereave you of your servant 

Come  come 
I love the king your father  and yourself 
With more than foreign heart  We every day 
Expect him here  when he shall come and find 
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted 
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage 
Blame both my lord and me  that we have taken 
No care to your best courses  Go  I pray you 
Walk  and be cheerful once again  reserve 
That excellent complexion  which did steal 
The eyes of young and old  Care not for me 
I can go home alone 

Well  I will go 
But yet I have no desire to it 

Come  come  I know tis good for you 
Walk half an hour  Leonine  at least 
Remember what I have said 

I warrant you  madam 

Ill leave you  my sweet lady  for a while 
Pray you walk softly  do not heat your blood 
What  I must have care of you 

My thanks  sweet madam 

Is this wind westerly that blows 

Southwest 

When I was born  the wind was north 

Was t so 

My father  as nurse said  did never fear 
But cried Good seamen  to the sailors  galling 
His kingly hands haling ropes 
And  clasping to the mast  endurd a sea 
That almost burst the deck 

When was this 

When I was born 
Never were waves nor wind more violent 
And from the laddertackle washes off 
A canvasclimber  Ha  says one  wilt out  
And with a dropping industry they skip 
From stem to stern  the boatswain whistles  and 
The master calls  and trebles their confusion 

Come  say your prayers 

What mean you 

If you require a little space for prayer 
I grant it  Pray  but be not tedious 
For the gods are quick of ear  and I am sworn 
To do my work with haste 

Why will you kill me 

To satisfy my lady 

Why would she have me killd 
Now  as I can remember  by my troth 
I never did her hurt in all my life 
I never spake bad word  nor did ill turn 
To any living creature  believe me  la 
I never killd a mouse  nor hurt a fly 
I trod upon a worm against my will 
But I wept for it  How have I offended 
Wherein my death might yield her any profit 
Or my life imply her any danger 

My commission 
Is not to reason of the deed  but do t 

You will not do t for all the world  I hope 
You are well favourd  and your looks foreshow 
You have a gentle heart  I saw you lately 
When you caught hurt in parting two that fought 
Good sooth  it showd well in you  do so now 
Your lady seeks my life  come you between 
And save poor me  the weaker 

I am sworn 
And will dispatch 


Hold  villain 


A prize  a prize 

Halfpart  mates  halfpart 
Come  lets have her aboard suddenly 

These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes 
And they have seizd Marina  Let her go 
Theres no hope shell return  Ill swear shes dead 
And thrown into the sea  But Ill see further 
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her 
Not carry her aboard  If she remain 
Whom they have ravishd must by me be slain 


Boult 

Sir 

Search the market narrowly  Mitylene is full of gallants  we lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless 

We were never so much out of creatures  We have but poor three  and they can do no more than they can do  and they with continual action are even as good as rotten 

Therefore  lets have fresh ones  whateer we pay for them  If there be not a conscience to be used in every trade  we shall never prosper 

Thou sayst true  tis not the bringing up of poor bastards  as  I think  I have brought up some eleven 

Ay  to eleven  and brought them down again  But shall I search the market 

What else  man  The stuff we have a strong wind will blow it to pieces  they are so pitifully sodden 

Thou sayst true  theyre too unwholesome  o conscience  The poor Transylvanian is dead  that lay with the little baggage 

Ay  she quickly pooped him  she made him roastmeat for worms  But Ill go search the market 


Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live quietly  and so give over 

Why to give over  I pray you  is it a shame to get when we are old 

O  our credit comes not in like the commodity  nor the commodity wages not with the danger  therefore  if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate  twere not amiss to keep our door hatched  Besides  the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving over 

Come  other sorts offend as well as we 

As well as we  ay  and better too  we offend worse  Neither is our profession any trade  its no calling  But here comes Boult 


Come your ways  My masters  you say shes a virgin 

O  sir  we doubt it not 

Master  I have gone through for this piece  you see  if you like her  so  if not  I have lost my earnest 

Boult  has she any qualities 

She has a good face  speaks well  and has excellent good clothes  theres no further necessity of qualities can make her be refused 

Whats her price  Boult 

I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces 

Well  follow me  my masters  you shall have your money presently  Wife  take her in  instruct her what she has to do  that she may not be raw in her entertainment 


Boult  take you the marks of her  the colour of her hair  complexion  height  age  with warrant of her virginity  and cry  He that will give most  shall have her first  Such a maidenhead were no cheap thing  if men were as they have been  Get this done as I command you 

Performance shall follow 


Alack  that Leonine was so slack  so slow 
He should have struck  not spoke  or that these pirates 
Not enough barbarous had not oerboard thrown me 
For to seek my mother 

Why lament you  pretty one 

That I am pretty 

Come  the gods have done their part in you 

I accuse them not 

You are lit into my hands  where you are like to live 

The more my fault 
To scape his hands where I was like to die 

Ay  and you shall live in pleasure 

No 

Yes  indeed  shall you  and taste gentlemen of all fashions  You shall fare well  you shall have the difference of all complexions  What  do you stop your ears 

Are you a woman 

What would you have me be  an I be not a woman 

An honest woman  or not a woman 

Marry  whip thee  gosling  I think I shall have something to do with you  Come  you are a young foolish sapling  and must be bowed as I would have you 

The gods defend me 

If it please the gods to defend you by men  then men must comfort you  men must feed you  men must stir you up  Boults returned 

Now  sir  hast thou cried her through the market 

I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs  I have drawn her picture with my voice 

And I prithee  tell me  how dost thou find the inclination of the people  especially of the younger sort 

Faith  they listened to me  as they would have hearkened to their fathers testament  There was a Spaniards mouth so watered  that he went to bed to her very description 

We shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff on 

Tonight  tonight  But  mistress  do you know the French knight that cowers i the hams 

Who  Monsieur Veroles 

Ay  he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation  but he made a groan at it  and swore he would see her tomorrow 

Well  well  as for him  he brought his disease hither  here he does but repair it  I know he will come in our shadow  to scatter his crowns in the sun 

Well  if we had of every nation a traveller  we should lodge them with this sign 

Pray you  come hither awhile  You have fortunes coming upon you  Mark me  you must seem to do that fearfully  which you commit willingly  to despise profit where you have most gain  To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers  seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion  and that opinion a mere profit 

I understand you not 

O  take her home  mistress  take her home  these blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practice 

Thou sayst true  i faith  so they must  for your bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go with warrant 

Faith  some do  and some do not  But  mistress  if I have bargained for the joint 

Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit 

I may so 

Who should deny it  Come  young one  I like the manner of your garments well 

Ay  by my faith  they shall not be changed yet 

Boult  spend thou that in the town  report what a sojourner we have  youll lose nothing by custom  When nature framed this piece  she meant thee a good turn  therefore say what a paragon she is  and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report 

I warrant you  mistress  thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up the lewdlyinclined  Ill bring home some tonight 

Come your ways  follow me 

If fires be hot  knives sharp  or waters deep 
Untied I still my virgin knot will keep 
Diana  aid my purpose 

What have we to do with Diana 
Pray you  will you go with us 


Why  are you foolish  Can it be undone 

O Dionyza  such a piece of slaughter 
The sun and moon neer lookd upon 

I think 
Youll turn a child again 

Were I chief lord of all this spacious world 
Id give it to undo the deed  O lady 
Much less in blood than virtue  yet a princess 
To equal any single crown o the earth 
I the justice of compare  O villain Leonine 
Whom thou hast poisond too 
If thou hadst drunk to him t had been a kindness 
Becoming well thy fact  what canst thou say 
When noble Pericles shall demand his child 

That she is dead  Nurses are not the fates 
To foster it  nor ever to preserve 
She died at night  Ill say so  Who can cross it 
Unless you play the pious innocent 
And for an honest attribute cry out 
She died by foul play  

O  go to  Well  well 
Of all the faults beneath the heavens  the gods 
Do like this worst 

Be one of those that think 
The pretty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence 
And open this to Pericles  I do shame 
To think of what a noble strain you are 
And of how coward a spirit 

To such proceeding 
Who ever but his approbation added 
Though not his prime consent  he did not flow 
From honourable sources 

Be it so  then 
Yet none does know but you how she came dead 
Nor none can know  Leonine being gone 
She did distain my child  and stood between 
Her and her fortunes  none would look on her 
But cast their gazes on Marinas face 
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin 
Not worth the time of day  It piercd me thorough 
And though you call my course unnatural 
You not your child well loving  yet I find 
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness 
Performd to your sole daughter 

Heavens forgive it 

And as for Pericles 
What should he say  We wept after her hearse 
And even yet we mourn  her monument 
Is almost finishd  and her epitaphs 
In glittering golden characters express 
A general praise to her  and care in us 
At whose expense tis done 

Thou art like the harpy 
Which  to betray  dost with thine angels face 
Seize with thine eagles talons 

You are like one that superstitiously 
Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies 
But yet I know youll do as I advise 

Thus time we waste  and longest leagues make short 
Sail seas in cockles  have an wish but for t 
Making to take your imagination 
From bourn to bourn  region to region 
By you being pardond  we commit no crime 
To use one language in each several clime 
Where our scenes seem to live  I do beseech you 
To learn of me  who stand i the gaps to teach you 
The stages of our story  Pericles 
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas 
Attended on by many a lord and knight 
To see his daughter  all his lifes delight 
Old Helicanus goes along  Behind 
Is left to govern it  you bear in mind 
Old Escanes  whom Helicanus late 
Advancd in time to great and high estate 
Wellsailing ships and bounteous winds have brought 
This king to Tarsus  think his pilot thought 
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on 
To fetch his daughter home  who first is gone 
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile 
Your ears unto your eyes Ill reconcile 


See how belief may suffer by foul show 
This borrowd passion stands for true old woe 
And Pericles  in sorrow all devourd 
With sighs shot through  and biggest tears oershowerd 
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks  He swears 
Never to wash his face  nor cut his hairs 
He puts on sackcloth  and to sea  He bears 
A tempest  which his mortal vessel tears 
And yet he rides it out  Now please you wit 
The epitaph is for Marina writ 
By wicked Dionyza 


the fairest  sweetst  and best lies here 
who witherd in her spring of year 
she was of tyrus the kings daughter 
on whom foul death hath made this slaughter 
marina was she calld  and at her birth 
thetis  being proud  swallowd some part o the earth 
therefore the earth  fearing to be oerflowd 
hath thetis birthchild on the heavens bestowd 
wherefore she does  and swears shell never stint 
make raging battery upon shores of flint 

No visor does become black villany 
So well as soft and tender flattery 
Let Pericles believe his daughters dead 
And bear his courses to be ordered 
By Lady Fortune  while our scene must play 
His daughters woe and heavy welladay 
In her unholy service  Patience then 
And think you now are all in Mitylen 


Did you ever hear the like 

No  nor never shall do in such a place as this  she being once gone 

But to have divinity preached there  did you ever dream of such a thing 

No  no  Come  I am for no more bawdyhouses  Shalls go hear the vestals sing 

Ill do any thing now that is virtuous  but I am out of the road of rutting for ever 


Well  I had rather than twice the worth of her she had neer come here 

Fie  fie upon her  she is able to freeze the god Priapus  and undo a whole generation  we must either get her ravished  or be rid of her  When she should do for clients her fitment  and do me the kindness of our profession  she has me her quirks  her reasons  her masterreasons  her prayers  her knees  that she would make a puritan of the devil if he should cheapen a kiss of her 

Faith  I must ravish her  or shell disfurnish us of all our cavaliers  and make all our swearers priests 

Now  the pox upon her greensickness for me 

Faith  theres no way to be rid on t but by the way to the pox  Here comes the Lord Lysimachus  disguised 

We should have both lord and lown if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers 


How now  How a dozen of virginities 

Now  the gods tobless your honour 

I am glad to see your honour in good health 

You may so  tis the better for you that your resorters stand upon sound legs  How now  wholesome iniquity  have you that a man may deal withal  and defy the surgeon 

We have here one  sir  if she would but there never came her like in Mitylene 

If shed do the deed of darkness  thou wouldst say 

Your honour knows what tis to say well enough 

Well  call forth  call forth 

For flesh and blood  sir  white and red  you shall see a rose  and she were a rose indeed if she had but 

What  prithee 

O  sir  I can be modest 

That dignifies the renown of a bawd no less than it gives a good report to a number to be chaste 


Here comes that which grows to the stalk  never plucked yet  I can assure you 

Is she not a fair creature 

Faith  she would serve after a long voyage at sea  Well  theres for you  leave us 

I beseech your honour  give me leave  a word  and Ill have done presently 

I beseech you do 

First  I would have you note  this is an honourable man 

I desire to find him so  that I may worthily note him 

Next  hes the governor of this country  and a man whom I am bound to 

If he govern the country  you are bound to him indeed  but how honourable he is in that I know not 

Pray you  without any more virginal fencing  will you use him kindly  He will line your apron with gold 

What he will do graciously  I will thankfully receive 

Ha you done 

My lord  shes not paced yet  you must take some pains to work her to your manage  Come  we will leave his honour and her together 

Go thy ways 

Now  pretty one  how long have you been at this trade 

What trade  sir 

Why  I cannot name t but I shall offend 

I cannot be offended with my trade  Please you to name it 

How long have you been of this profession 

Eer since I can remember 

Did you go to t so young  Were you a gamester at five or at seven 

Earlier too  sir  if now I be one 

Why  the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of sale 

Do you know this house to be a place of such resort  and will come into t  I hear say you are of honourable parts  and are the governor of this place 

Why  hath your principal made known unto you who I am 

Who is my principal 

Why  your herbwoman  she that sets seeds and roots of shame and iniquity  O  you have heard something of my power  and so stand aloof for more serious wooing  But I protest to thee  pretty one  my authority shall not see thee  or else look friendly upon thee  Come  bring me to some private place  come  come 

If you were born to honour  show it now 
If put upon you  make the judgment good 
That thought you worthy of it 

Hows this  hows this  Some more  be sage 

For me 
That am a maid  though most ungentle fortune 
Hath placd me in this sty  where  since I came 
Diseases have been sold dearer than physic 
O  that the gods 
Would set me free from this unhallowd place 
Though they did change me to the meanest bird 
That flies i the purer air 

I did not think 
Thou couldst have spoke so well  neer dreamd thou couldst 
Had I brought hither a corrupted mind 
Thy speech had alterd it  Hold  heres gold for thee 
Persever in that clear way thou goest 
And the gods strengthen thee 

The good gods preserve you 

For me  be you thoughten 
That I came with no ill intent  for to me 
The very doors and windows savour vilely 
Farewell  Thou art a piece of virtue  and 
I doubt not but thy training hath been noble 
Hold  heres more gold for thee 
A curse upon him  die he like a thief 
That robs thee of thy goodness  If thou dost 
Hear from me  it shall be for thy good 


I beseech your honour  one piece for me 

Avaunt  thou damned doorkeeper  Your house 
But for this virgin that doth prop it  would 
Sink and overwhelm you  Away 


Hows this  We must take another course with you  If your peevish chastity  which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope  shall undo a whole household  let me be gelded like a spaniel  Come your ways 

Whither would you have me 

I must have your maidenhead taken off  or the common hangman shall execute it  Come your ways  Well have no more gentlemen driven away  Come your ways  I say 


How now  whats the matter 

Worse and worse  mistress  she has here spoken holy words to the Lord Lysimachus 

O  abominable 

She makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of the gods 

Marry  hang her up for ever 

The nobleman would have dealt with her like a nobleman  and she sent him away as cold as a snowball  saying his prayers too 

Boult  take her away  use her at thy pleasure  crack the glass of her virginity  and make the rest malleable 

An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she is  she shall be ploughed 

Hark  hark  you gods 

She conjures  away with her  Would she had never come within my doors  Marry  hang you  Shes born to undo us  Will you not go the way of womenkind  Marry  come up  my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays 


Come  mistress  come your ways with me 

Whither wilt thou have me 

To take from you the jewel you hold so dear 

Prithee  tell me one thing first 

Come now  your one thing 

What canst thou wish thine enemy to be 

Why  I could wish him to be my master  or rather  my mistress 

Neither of these are so bad as thou art 
Since they do better thee in their command 
Thou holdst a place  for which the painedst fiend 
Of hell would not in reputation change 
Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every 
Coystril that comes inquiring for his Tib 
To the choleric fisting of every rogue 
Thy ear is liable  thy food is such 
As hath been belchd on by infected lungs 

What would you have me do  go to the wars  would you  where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg  and have not money enough in the end to buy him a wooden one 

Do any thing but this thou doest  Empty 
Old receptacles  or common sewers  of filth 
Serve by indenture to the common hangman 
Any of these ways are yet better than this 
For what thou professest  a baboon  could he speak 
Would own a name too dear  O  that the gods 
Would safely deliver me from this place 
Here  heres gold for thee 
If that thy master would gain by me 
Proclaim that I can sing  weave  sew  and dance 
With other virtues  which Ill keep from boast 
And I will undertake all these to teach 
I doubt not but this populous city will 
Yield many scholars 

But can you teach all this you speak of 

Prove that I cannot  take me home again 
And prostitute me to the basest groom 
That doth frequent your house 

Well  I will see what I can do for thee  if I can place thee  I will 

But  amongst honest women 

Faith  my acquaintance lies little amongst them  But since my master and mistress have bought you  theres no going but by their consent  therefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose  and I doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough  Come  Ill do for thee what I can  come your ways 


Marina thus the brothel scapes  and chances 
Into an honest house  our story says 
She sings like one immortal  and she dances 
As goddesslike to her admired lays 
Deep clerks she dumbs  and with her neeld composes 
Natures own shape  of bud  bird  branch  or berry 
That even her art sisters the natural roses 
Her inkle  silk  twin with the rubied cherry 
That pupils lacks she none of noble race 
Who pour their bounty on her  and her gain 
She gives the cursed bawd  Here we her place 
And to her father turn our thoughts again 
Where we left him  on the sea  We there him lost 
Whence  driven before the winds  he is arrivd 
Here where his daughter dwells  and on this coast 
Suppose him now at anchor  The city strivd 
God Neptunes annual feast to keep  from whence 
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies 
His banners sable  trimmd with rich expense 
And to him in his barge with fervour hies 
In your supposing once more put your sight 
Of heavy Pericles  think this his bark 
Where what is done in action  more  if might 
Shall be discoverd  please you  sit and hark 

Wheres the Lord Helicanus  he can resolve you 
O  here he is 
Sir  theres a barge put off from Mitylene 
And in it is Lysimachus  the governor 
Who craves to come aboard  What is your will 

That he have his  Call up some gentlemen 

Ho  gentlemen  my lord calls 


Doth your lordship call 

Gentlemen  theres some of worth would come aboard 
I pray ye  greet them fairly 

Sir 
This is the man that can  in aught you would 
Resolve you 

Hail  reverend sir  The gods preserve you 

And you  sir  to outlive the age I am 
And die as I would do 

You wish me well 
Being on shore  honouring of Neptunes triumphs 
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us 
I made to it to know of whence you are 

First  what is your place 

I am the governor of this place you lie before 

Sir 
Our vessel is of Tyre  in it the king 
A man who for this three months hath not spoken 
To any one  nor taken sustenance 
But to prorogue his grief 

Upon what ground is his distemperature 

Twould be too tedious to repeat 
But the main grief springs from the loss 
Of a beloved daughter and a wife 

May we not see him 

You may 
But bootless is your sight  he will not speak 
To any 

Yet let me obtain my wish 

Behold him 

This was a goodly person 
Till the disaster that  one mortal night 
Drove him to this 

Sir king  all hail  the gods preserve you 
Hall  royal sir 

It is in vain  he will not speak to you 

Sir 
We have a maid in Mitylene  I durst wager 
Would win some words of him 

Tis well bethought 
She questionless with her sweet harmony 
And other chosen attractions  would allure 
And make a battery through his deafend ports 
Which now are midway stoppd 
She is all happy as the fairst of all 
And with her fellow maids is now upon 
The leafy shelter that abuts against 
The islands side 


Sure  alls effectless  yet nothing well omit 
That bears recoverys name  But  since your kindness 
We have stretchd thus far  let us beseech you 
That for our gold we may provision have 
Wherein we are not destitute for want 
But weary for the staleness 

O  sir  a courtesy 
Which if we should deny  the most just gods 
For every graff would send a caterpillar 
And so afflict our province  Yet once more 
Let me entreat to know at large the cause 
Of your kings sorrow 

Sit  sir  I will recount it to you 
But see  I am prevented 


O  here is 
The lady that I sent for  Welcome  fair one 
Ist not a goodly presence 

Shes a gallant lady 

Shes such a one  that were I well assurd 
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock 
Id wish no better choice  and think me rarely wed 
Fair one  all goodness that consists in bounty 
Expect even here  where is a kingly patient 
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat 
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught 
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay 
As thy desires can wish 

Sir  I will use 
My utmost skill in his recovery 
Provided 
That none but I and my companion maid 
Be sufferd to come near him 

Come  let us leave her 
And the gods make her prosperous 


Markd he your music 

No  nor lookd on us 

See  she will speak to him 

Hail  sir  my lord  lend ear 

Hum  ha 

I am a maid 
My lord  that neer before invited eyes 
But have been gazd on like a comet  she speaks 
My lord  that  may be  hath endurd a grief 
Might equal yours  if both were justly weighd 
Though wayward Fortune did malign my state 
My derivation was from ancestors 
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings 
But time hath rooted out my parentage 
And to the world and awkward casualties 
Bound me in servitude 

I will desist 
But there is something glows upon my cheek 
And whispers in mine ear  Go not till he speak  

My fortunes parentage good parentage 
To equal mine was it not thus  what say you 

I said  my lord  if you did know my parentage 
You would not do me violence 

I do think so  Pray you  turn your eyes upon me 
You are like something that What countrywoman 
Here of these shores 

No  nor of any shores 
Yet I was mortally brought forth  and am 
No other than I appear 

I am great with woe  and shall deliver weeping 
My dearest wife was like this maid  and such a one 
My daughter might have been  my queens square brows 
Her stature to an inch  as wandlike straight 
As silvervoicd  her eyes as jewellike 
And casd as richly  in pace another Juno 
Who starves the ears she feeds  and makes them hungry 
The more she gives them speech  Where do you live 

Where I am but a stranger  from the deck 
You may discern the place 

Where were you bred 
And how achievd you these endowments  which 
You make more rich to owe 

Should I tell my history  it would seem 
Like lies  disdaind in the reporting 

Prithee  speak 
Falseness cannot come from thee  for thou lookst 
Modest as justice  and thou seemst a palace 
For the crownd truth to dwell in  I believe thee 
And make my senses credit thy relation 
To points that seem impossible  for thou lookest 
Like one I lovd indeed  What were thy friends 
Didst thou not say when I did push thee back 
Which was when I perceivd thee that thou camst 
From good descending 

So indeed I did 

Report thy parentage  I think thou saidst 
Thou hadst been tossd from wrong to injury 
And that thou thoughtst thy griefs might equal mine 
If both were opend 

Some such thing 
I said  and said no more but what my thoughts 
Did warrant me was likely 

Tell thy story 
If thine considerd prove the thousandth part 
Of my endurance  thou art a man  and I 
Have sufferd like a girl  yet thou dost look 
Like Patience gazing on kings graves  and smiling 
Extremity out of act  What were thy friends 
How lost thou them  Thy name  my most kind virgin 
Recount  I do beseech thee  Come  sit by me 

My name is Marina 

O  I am mockd 
And thou by some incensed god sent hither 
To make the world to laugh at me 

Patience  good sir 
Or here Ill cease 

Nay  Ill be patient 
Thou little knowst how thou dost startle me 
To call thyself Marina 

The name 
Was given me by one that had some power 
My father  and a king 

How  a kings daughter 
And calld Marina 

You said you would believe me 
But  not to be a troubler of your peace 
I will end here 

But are you flesh and blood 
Have you a working pulse  and are no fairy 
Motion Well  speak on  Where were you born 
And wherefore calld Marina 

Calld Marina 
For I was born at sea 

At sea  what mother 

My mother was the daughter of a king 
Who died the minute I was born 
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft 
Deliverd weeping 

O  stop there a little 
This is the rarest dream that eer dull sleep 
Did mock sad fools withal  this cannot be 
My daughters buried  Well  where were you bred 
Ill hear you more  to the bottom of your story 
And never interrupt you 

Youll scorn to believe me  twere best I did give oer 

I will believe you by the syllable 
Of what you shall deliver  Yet  give me leave 
How came you in these parts  where were you bred 

The king my father did in Tarsus leave me 
Till cruel Cleon  with his wicked wife 
Did seek to murder me  and having wood 
A villain to attempt it  who having drawn to do t 
A crew of pirates came and rescud me 
Brought me to Mitylene  But  good sir 
Whither will you have me  Why do you weep  It may be 
You think me an impostor  no  good faith 
I am the daughter to King Pericles 
If good King Pericles be 

Ho  Helicanus 

Calls my lord 

Thou art a grave and noble counsellor 
Most wise in general  tell me  if thou canst 
What this maid is  or what is like to be 
That thus hath made me weep 

I know not  but 
Here is the regent  sir  of Mitylene 
Speaks nobly of her 

She never would tell 
Her parentage  being demanded that 
She would sit still and weep 

O Helicanus  strike me  honourd sir 
Give me a gash  put me to present pain 
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me 
Oerbear the shores of my mortality 
And drown me with their sweetness  O  come hither 
Thou that begettst him that did thee beget 
Thou that wast born at sea  buried at Tarsus 
And found at sea again  O Helicanus 
Down on thy knees  thank the holy gods as loud 
As thunder threatens us  this is Marina 
What was thy mothers name  tell me but that 
For truth can never be confirmd enough 
Though doubts did ever sleep 

First  sir  I pray 
What is your title 

I am Pericles of Tyre  but tell me now 
My drownd queens name  as in the rest you said 
Thou hast been godlike perfect 
Thourt heir of kingdoms  and another life 
To Pericles thy father 

Is it no more to be your daughter than 
To say my mothers name was Thaisa 
Thaisa was my mother  who did end 
The minute I began 

Now  blessing on thee  rise  thou art my child 
Give me fresh garments  Mine own  Helicanus 
She is not dead at Tarsus  as she should have been 
By savage Cleon  she shall tell thee all 
When thou shalt kneel  and justify in knowledge 
She is thy very princess  Who is this 

Sir  tis the governor of Mitylene 
Who  hearing of your melancholy state 
Did come to see you 

I embrace you 
Give me my robes  I am wild in my beholding 
O heavens  bless my girl  But  hark  what music 
Tell Helicanus  my Marina  tell him 
Oer  point by point  for yet he seems to doubt 
How sure you are my daughter  But  what music 

My lord  I hear none 

None 
The music of the spheres  List  my Marina 

It is not good to cross him  give him way 

Rarest sounds  Do ye not hear 

My lord  I hear 


Most heavenly music 
It nips me unto listning  and thick slumber 
Hangs upon mine eyes  let me rest 


A pillow for his head 
So  leave him all  Well  my companion friends 
If this but answer to my just belief 
Ill well remember you 

My temple stands in Ephesus  hie thee thither 
And do upon mine altar sacrifice 
There  when my maiden priests are met together 
Before the people all 
Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife 
To mourn thy crosses  with thy daughters  call 
And give them repetition to the life 
Perform my bidding  or thou livst in woe 
Do it  and happy  by my silver bow 
Awake  and tell thy dream 


Celestial Dian  goddess argentine 
I will obey thee  Helicanus 


Sir 

My purpose was for Tarsus  there to strike 
The inhospitable Cleon  but I am 
For other service first  toward Ephesus 
Turn our blown sails  eftsoons Ill tell thee why 


Shall we refresh us  sir  upon your shore 
And give you gold for such provision 
As our intents will need 

Sir 
With all my heart  and when you come ashore 
I have another suit 

You shall prevail 
Were it to woo my daughter  for it seems 
You have been noble towards her 

Sir  lend me your arm 

Come  my Marina 


Now our sands are almost run 
More a little  and then dumb 
This  my last boon  give me 
For such kindness must relieve me 
That you aptly will suppose 
What pageantry  what feats  what shows 
What minstrelsy  and pretty din 
The regent made in Mitylen 
To greet the king  So he thrivd 
That he is promisd to be wivd 
To fair Marina  but in no wise 
Till he had done his sacrifice 
As Dian bade  whereto being bound 
The interim  pray you  all confound 
In featherd briefness sails are filld 
And wishes fall out as theyre willd 
At Ephesus  the temple see 
Our king and all his company 
That he can hither come so soon 
Is by your fancys thankful doom 

Hail  Dian  to perform thy just command 
I here confess myself the King of Tyre 
Who  frighted from my country  did wed 
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa 
At sea in childbed died she  but brought forth 
A maidchild calld Marina  who  O goddess 
Wears yet thy silver livery  She at Tarsus 
Was nursd with Cleon  whom at fourteen years 
He sought to murder  but her better stars 
Brought her to Mitylene  gainst whose shore 
Riding  her fortunes brought the maid aboard us 
Where  by her own most clear remembrance  she 
Made known herself my daughter 

Voice and favour 
You are  you are O royal Pericles 


What means the nun  she dies  help  gentlemen 

Noble sir 
If you have told Dianas altar true 
This is your wife 

Reverend appearer  no 
I threw her oerboard with these very arms 

Upon this coast  I warrant you 

Tis most certain 

Look to the lady  O  shes but oerjoyd 
Early in blustering morn this lady was 
Thrown upon this shore  I opd the coffin 
Found there rich jewels  recoverd her  and placd her 
Here in Dianas temple 

May we see them 

Great sir  they shall be brought you to my house 
Whither I invite you  Look  Thaisa is 
Recovered 

O  let me look 
If he be none of mine  my sanctity 
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear 
But curb it  spite of seeing  O  my lord 
Are you not Pericles  Like him you speak 
Like him you are  Did you not name a tempest 
A birth  and death 

The voice of dead Thaisa 

That Thaisa am I  supposed dead 
And drownd 

Immortal Dian 

Now I know you better 
When we with tears parted Pentapolis 
The king my father gave you such a ring 


This  this  no more  you gods  your present kindness 
Makes my past miseries sport  you shall do well 
That on the touching of her lips I may 
Melt and no more be seen  O  come  be buried 
A second time within these arms 

My heart 
Leaps to be gone into my mothers bosom 


Look  who kneels here  Flesh of thy flesh  Thaisa 
Thy burden at the sea  and calld Marina 
For she was yielded there 

Blessd  and mine own 

Hail  madam  and my queen 

I know you not 

You have heard me say  when I did fly from Tyre 
I left behind an ancient substitute 
Can you remember what I calld the man 
I have namd him oft 

Twas Helicanus then 

Still confirmation 
Embrace him  dear Thaisa  this is he 
Now do I long to hear how you were found 
How possibly preservd  and whom to thank 
Besides the gods  for this great miracle 

Lord Cerimon  my lord  this man 
Through whom the gods have shown their power  that can 
From first to last resolve you 

Reverend sir 
The gods can have no mortal officer 
More like a god than you  Will you deliver 
How this dead queen relives 

I will  my lord 
Beseech you  first go with me to my house 
Where shall be shown you all was found with her 
How she came placed here in the temple 
No needful thing omitted 

Pure Dian  bless thee for thy vision  I 
Will offer nightoblations to thee  Thaisa 
This prince  the fairbetrothed of your daughter 
Shall marry her at Pentapolis  And now 
This ornament 
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form 
And what this fourteen years no rasor touchd 
To grace thy marriageday Ill beautify 

Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit  sir 
My fathers dead 

Heavens make a star of him  Yet there  my queen 
Well celebrate their nuptials  and ourselves 
Will in that kingdom spend our following days 
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign 
Lord Cerimon  we do our longing stay 
To hear the rest untold  Sir  leads the way 

In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard 
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward 
In Pericles  his queen  and daughter  seen 
Although assaild with fortune fierce and keen 
Virtue preservd from fell destructions blast 
Led on by heaven  and crownd with joy at last 
In Helicanus may you well descry 
A figure of truth  of faith  of loyalty 
In reverend Cerimon there well appears 
The worth that learned charity aye wears 
For wicked Cleon and his wife  when fame 
Had spread their cursed deed  and honourd name 
Of Pericles  to rage the city turn 
That him and his they in his palace burn 
The gods for murder seemed so content 
To punish them  although not done  but meant 
So on your patience evermore attending 
New joy wait on you  Here our play hath ending
