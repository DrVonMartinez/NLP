ROMEO AND JULIET

Two households  both alike in dignity 
In fair Verona  where we lay our scene 
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny 
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean 
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes 
A pair of starcrossd lovers take their life 
Whose misadventurd piteous overthrows 
Do with their death bury their parents strife 
The fearful passage of their deathmarkd love 
And the continuance of their parents rage 
Which  but their childrens end  nought could remove 
Is now the two hours traffick of our stage 
The which if you with patient ears attend 
What here shall miss  our toil shall strive to mend 

Gregory  o my word  well not carry coals 

No  for then we should be colliers 

I mean  an we be in choler  well draw 

Ay  while you live  draw your neck out o the collar 

I strike quickly  being moved 

But thou art not quickly moved to strike 

A dog of the house of Montague moves me 

To move is to stir  and to be valiant is to stand  therefore  if thou art moved  thou runnest away 

A dog of that house shall move me to stand  I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montagues 

That shows thee a weak slave  for the weakest goes to the wall 

Tis true  and therefore women  being the weaker vessels  are ever thrust to the wall  therefore I will push Montagues men from the wall  and thrust his maids to the wall 

The quarrel is between our masters and us their men 

Tis all one  I will show myself a tyrant  when I have fought with the men  I will be cruel with the maids  I will cut off their heads 

The heads of the maids 

Ay  the heads of the maids  or their maidenheads  take it in what sense thou wilt 

They must take it in sense that feel it 

Me they shall feel while I am able to stand  and tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh 

Tis well thou art not fish  if thou hadst  thou hadst been poor John  Draw thy tool  here comes two of the house of the Montagues 


My naked weapon is out  quarrel  I will back thee 

How  turn thy back and run 

Fear me not 

No  marry  I fear thee 

Let us take the law of our sides  let them begin 

I will frown as I pass by  and let them take it as they list 

Nay  as they dare  I will bite my thumb at them  which is a disgrace to them  if they bear it 

Do you bite your thumb at us  sir 

I do bite my thumb  sir 

Do you bite your thumb at us  sir 

Is the law of our side if I say ay 

No 

No  sir  I do not bite my thumb at you  sir  but I bite my thumb  sir 

Do you quarrel  sir 

Quarrel  sir  no  sir 

If you do  sir  I am for you  I serve as good a man as you 

No better 

Well  sir 

Say  better  here comes one of my masters kinsmen 

Yes  better  sir 

You lie 

Draw  if you be men  Gregory  remember thy swashing blow 

Part  fools 
Put up your swords  you know not what you do 

What  art thou drawn among these heartless hinds 
Turnthee  Benvolio  look upon thy death 

I do but keep the peace  put up thy sword 
Or manage it to part these men with me 

What  drawn  and talk of peace  I hate the word 
As I hate hell  all Montagues  and thee 
Have at thee  coward 


Clubs  bills  and partisans  strike  beat them down 
Down with the Capulets  down with the Montagues 


What noise is this  Give me my long sword  ho 

A crutch  a crutch  Why call you for a sword 

My sword  I say  Old Montague is come 
And flourishes his blade in spite of me 


Thou villain Capulet  Hold me not  let me go 

Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe 


Rebellious subjects  enemies to peace 
Profaners of this neighbourstained steel 
Will they not hear  What ho  you men  you beasts 
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage 
With purple fountains issuing from your veins 
On pain of torture  from those bloody hands 
Throw your mistemperd weapons to the ground 
And hear the sentence of your moved prince 
Three civil brawls  bred of an airy word 
By thee  old Capulet  and Montague 
Have thrice disturbd the quiet of our streets 
And made Veronas ancient citizens 
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments 
To wield old partisans  in hands as old 
Cankerd with peace  to part your cankerd hate 
If ever you disturb our streets again 
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace 
For this time  all the rest depart away 
You  Capulet  shall go along with me 
And  Montague  come you this afternoon 
To know our further pleasure in this case 
To old Freetown  our common judgmentplace 
Once more  on pain of death  all men depart 


Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach 
Speak  nephew  were you by when it began 

Here were the servants of your adversary 
And yours close fighting ere I did approach 
I drew to part them  in the instant came 
The fiery Tybalt  with his sword prepard 
Which  as he breathd defiance to my ears 
He swung about his head  and cut the winds 
Who  nothing hurt withal hissd him in scorn 
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows 
Came more and more  and fought on part and part 
Till the prince came  who parted either part 

O  where is Romeo  saw you him today 
Right glad I am he was not at this fray 

Madam  an hour before the worshippd sun 
Peerd forth the golden window of the east 
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad 
Where  underneath the grove of sycamore 
That westward rooteth from the citys side 
So early walking did I see your son 
Towards him I made  but he was ware of me 
And stole into the covert of the wood 
I  measuring his affections by my own 
That most are busied when theyre most alone 
Pursud my humour not pursuing his 
And gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me 

Many a morning hath he there been seen 
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew 
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs 
But all so soon as the allcheering sun 
Should in the furthest east begin to draw 
The shady curtains from Auroras bed 
Away from light steals home my heavy son 
And private in his chamber pens himself 
Shuts up his windows  locks fair daylight out 
And makes himself an artificial night 
Black and portentous must this humour prove 
Unless goodcounsel may the cause remove 

My noble uncle  do you know the cause 

I neither know it nor can learn of him 

Have you importund him by any means 

Both by myself and many other friends 
But he  his own affections counsellor 
Is to himself  I will not say how true 
But to himself so secret and so close 
So far from sounding and discovery 
As is the bud bit with an envious worm 
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air 
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun 
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow 
We would as willingly give cure as know 

See where he comes  so please you  step aside 
Ill know his grievance  or be much denied 

I would thou wert so happy by thy stay 
To hear true shrift  Come  madam  lets away 

Good morrow  cousin 

Is the day so young 

But new struck nine 

Ay me  sad hours seem long 
Was that my father that went hence so fast 

It was  What sadness lengthens Romeos hours 

Not having that  which having  makes them short 

In love 

Out 

Of love 

Out of her favour  where I am in love 

Alas  that love  so gentle in his view 
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof 

Alas  that love  whose view is muffled still 
Should  without eyes  see pathways to his will 
Where shall we dine  O me  What fray was here 
Yet tell me not  for I have heard it all 
Heres much to do with hate  but more with love 
Why then  O brawling love  O loving hate 
O any thing  of nothing first create 
O heavy lightness  serious vanity 
Misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms 
Feather of lead  bright smoke  cold fire  sick health 
Stillwaking sleep  that is not what it is 
This love feel I  that feel no love in this 
Dost thou not laugh 

No  coz  I rather weep 

Good heart  at what 

At thy good hearts oppression 

Why  such is loves transgression 
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast 
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressd 
With more of thine  this love that thou hast shown 
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own 
Love is a smoke raisd with the fume of sighs 
Being purgd  a fire sparkling in lovers eyes 
Being vexd  a sea nourishd with lovers tears 
What is it else  a madness most discreet 
A choking gall  and a preserving sweet 
Farewell  my coz 


Soft  I will go along 
An if you leave me so  you do me wrong 

Tut  I have lost myself  I am not here 
This is not Romeo  hes some other where 

Tell me in sadness  who is that you love 

What  shall I groan and tell thee 

Groan  why  no 
But sadly tell me who 

Bid a sick man in sadness make his will 
Ah  word ill urgd to one that is so ill 
In sadness  cousin  I do love a woman 

I aimd so near when I supposd you lovd 

A right good markman  And shes fair I love 

A right fair mark  fair coz  is soonest hit 

Well  in that hit you miss  shell not be hit 
With Cupids arrow  she hath Dians wit 
And  in strong proof of chastity well armd 
From loves weak childish bow she lives unharmd 
She will not stay the siege of loving terms 
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes 
Nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold 
O  she is rich in beauty  only poor 
That  when she dies  with beauty dies her store 

Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste 

She hath  and in that sparing makes huge waste 
For beauty  starvd with her severity 
Cuts beauty off from all posterity 
She is too fair  too wise  wisely too fair 
To merit bliss by making me despair 
She hath forsworn to love  and in that vow 
Do I live dead that live to tell it now 

Be ruld by me  forget to think of her 

O  teach me how I should forget to think 

By giving liberty unto thine eyes 
Examine other beauties 

Tis the way 
To call hers exquisite  in question more 
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows 
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair 
He  that is strucken blind cannot forget 
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost 
Show me a mistress that is passing fair 
What doth her beauty serve but as a note 
Where I may read who passd that passing fair 
Farewell  thou canst not teach me to forget 

Ill pay that doctrine  or else die in debt 


But Montague is bound as well as I 
In penalty alike  and tis not hard  I think 
For men so old as we to keep the peace 

Of honourable reckoning are you both 
And pity tis you livd at odds so long 
But now  my lord  what say you to my suit 

But saying oer what I have said before 
My child is yet a stranger in the world 
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years 
Let two more summers wither in their pride 
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride 

Younger than she are happy mothers made 

And too soon marrd are those so early made 
Earth hath swallowd all my hopes but she 
She is the hopeful lady of my earth 
But woo her  gentle Paris  get her heart 
My will to her consent is but a part 
An she agree  within her scope of choice 
Lies my consent and fair according voice 
This night I hold an old accustomd feast 
Whereto I have invited many a guest 
Such as I love  and you  among the store 
One more  most welcome  makes my number more 
At my poor house look to behold this night 
Earthtreading stars that make dark heaven light 
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel 
When wellappareld April on the heel 
Of limping winter treads  even such delight 
Among fresh female buds shall you this night 
Inherit at my house  hear all  all see 
And like her most whose merit most shall be 
Which on more view  of many mine being one 
May stand in number  though in reckoning none 
Come  go with me 

Go  sirrah  trudge about 
Through fair Verona  find those persons out 
Whose names are written there  and to them say 
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay 


Find them out whose names are written here  It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard  and the tailor with his last  the fisher with his pencil  and the painter with his nets  but I am sent to find those persons  whose names are here writ  and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ  I must to the learned  In good time 


Tut  man  one fire burns out anothers burning 
One pain is lessend by anothers anguish 
Turn giddy  and be holp by backward turning 
One desperate grief cures with anothers languish 
Take thou some new infection to thy eye 
And the rank poison of the old will die 

Your plantain leaf is excellent for that 

For what  I pray thee 

For your broken shin 

Why  Romeo  art thou mad 

Not mad  but bound more than a madman is 
Shut up in prison  kept without my food 
Whippd and tormented  and Good den  good fellow 

God gi good den  I pray  sir  can you read 

Ay  mine own fortune in my misery 

Perhaps you have learnd it without book  but  I pray  can you read any thing you see 

Ay  if I know the letters and the language 

Ye say honestly  rest you merry 


Stay  fellow  I can read 
Signior Martino and his wife and daughters  County Anselme and his beauteous sisters  the lady widow of Vitruvio  Signior Placentio  and his lovely nieces  Mercutio and his brother Valentine  mine uncle Capulet  his wife and daughters  my fair niece Rosaline  Livia  Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt  Lucio and the lively Helena 
A fair assembly  whither should they come 

Up 

Whither 

To supper  to our house 

Whose house 

My masters 

Indeed  I should have asked you that before 

Now Ill tell you without asking  My master is the great rich Capulet  and if you be not of the house of Montagues  I pray  come and crush a cup of wine  Rest you merry 


At this same ancient feast of Capulets 
Sups the fair Rosaline  whom thou so lovst 
With all the admired beauties of Verona 
Go thither  and  with unattainted eye 
Compare her face with some that I shall show 
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow 

When the devout religion of mine eye 
Maintains such falsehood  then turn tears to fires 
And these  who often drownd could never die 
Transparent heretics  be burnt for liars 
One fairer than my love  the allseeing sun 
Neer saw her match since first the world begun 

Tut  you saw her fair  none else being by 
Herself poisd with herself in either eye 
But in that crystal scales let there be weighd 
Your ladys love against some other maid 
That I will show you shining at this feast 
And she shall scant show well that now shows best 

Ill go along  no such sight to be shown 
But to rejoice in splendour of mine own 


Nurse  wheres my daughter  call her forth to me 

Now  by my maidenhead  at twelve year old 
I bade her come  What  lamb  what  ladybird 
God forbid  wheres this girl  what  Juliet 


How now  who calls 

Your mother 

Madam  I am here 
What is your will 

This is the matter  Nurse  give leave awhile 
We must talk in secret  nurse  come back again 
I have rememberd me  thous hear our counsel 
Thou knowst my daughters of a pretty age 

Faith  I can tell her age unto an hour 

Shes not fourteen 

Ill lay fourteen of my teeth 
And yet to my teen be it spoken I have but four 
She is not fourteen  How long is it now 
To Lammastide 

A fortnight and odd days 

Even or odd  of all days in the year 
Come Lammaseve at night shall she be fourteen 
Susan and she God rest all Christian souls 
Were of an age  Well  Susan is with God 
She was too good for me  But  as I said 
On Lammaseve at night shall she be fourteen 
That shall she  marry  I remember it well 
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years 
And she was weand  I never shall forget it 
Of all the days of the year  upon that day 
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug 
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall 
My lord and you were then at Mantua 
Nay  I do bear a brain but  as I said 
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple 
Of my dug and felt it bitter  pretty fool 
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug 
Shake  quoth the dovehouse  twas no need  I trow 
To bid me trudge 
And since that time it is eleven years 
For then she could stand high lone  nay  by the rood 
She could have run and waddled all about 
For even the day before she broke her brow 
And then my husband God be with his soul 
A was a merry man took up the child 
Yea  quoth he  dost thou fall upon thy face 
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit 
Wilt thou not  Jule  and  by my halidom 
The pretty wretch left crying  and said Ay  
To see now how a jest shall come about 
I warrant  an I should live a thousand years 
I never should forget it  Wilt thou not  Jule  quoth he 
And  pretty fool  it stinted and said Ay  

Enough of this  I pray thee  hold thy peace 

Yes  madam  Yet I cannot choose but laugh 
To think it should leave crying  and say Ay  
And yet  I warrant  it had upon its brow 
A bump as big as a young cockerels stone 
A parlous knock  and it cried bitterly 
Yea  quoth my husband  fallst upon thy face 
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comst to age 
Wilt thou not  Jule  it stinted and said Ay  

And stint thou too  I pray thee  nurse  say I 

Peace  I have done  God mark thee to his grace 
Thou wast the prettiest babe that eer I nursed 
An I might live to see thee married once 
I have my wish 

Marry  that marry is the very theme 
I came to talk of  Tell me  daughter Juliet 
How stands your disposition to be married 

It is an honour that I dream not of 

An honour  were not I thine only nurse 
I would say thou hadst suckd wisdom from thy teat 

Well  think of marriage now  younger than you 
Here in Verona  ladies of esteem 
Are made already mothers  by my count 
I was your mother much upon these years 
That you are now a maid  Thus then in brief 
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love 

A man  young lady  lady  such a man 
As all the world why  hes a man of wax 

Veronas summer hath not such a flower 

Nay  hes a flower  in faith  a very flower 

What say you  can you love the gentleman 
This night you shall behold him at our feast 
Read oer the volume of young Paris face 
And find delight writ there with beautys pen 
Examine every married lineament 
And see how one another lends content 
And what obscurd in this fair volume lies 
Find written in the margent of his eyes 
This precious book of love  this unbound lover 
To beautify him  only lacks a cover 
The fish lives in the sea  and tis much pride 
For fair without the fair within to hide 
That book in many eyes doth share the glory 
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story 
So shall you share all that he doth possess 
By having him making yourself no less 

No less  nay  bigger  women grow by men 

Speak briefly  can you like of Paris love 

Ill look to like  if looking liking move 
But no more deep will I endart mine eye 
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly 


Madam  the guests are come  supper served up  you called  my young lady asked for  the nurse cursed in the pantry  and everything in extremity  I must hence to wait  I beseech you  follow straight 

We follow thee  Juliet  the county stays 

Go  girl  seek happy nights to happy days 


What  shall this speech be spoke for our excuse 
Or shall we on without apology 

The date is out of such prolixity 
Well have no Cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf 
Bearing a Tartars painted bow of lath 
Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper 
Nor no withoutbook prologue  faintly spoke 
After the prompter  for our entrance 
But  let them measure us by what they will 
Well measure them a measure  and be gone 

Give me a torch  I am not for this ambling 
Being but heavy  I will bear the light 

Nay  gentle Romeo  we must have you dance 

Not I  believe me  you have dancing shoes 
With nimble soles  I have a soul of lead 
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move 

You are a lover  borrow Cupids wings 
And soar with them above a common bound 

I am too sore enpierced with his shaft 
To soar with his light feathers  and so bound 
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe 
Under loves heavy burden do I sink 

And  to sink in it  should you burden love 
Too great oppression for a tender thing 

Is love a tender thing  it is too rough 
Too rude  too boisterous  and it pricks like thorn 

If love be rough with you  be rough with love 
Prick love for pricking  and you beat love down 
Give me a case to put my visage in 

A visor for a visor  what care I 
What curious eye doth quote deformities 
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me 

Come  knock and enter  and no sooner in 
But every man betake him to his legs 

A torch for me  let wantons  light of heart 
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels 
For I am proverbd with a grandsire phrase 
Ill be a candle holder  and look on 
The game was neer so fair  and I am done 

Tut  duns the mouse  the constables own word 
If thou art Dun  well draw thee from the mire 
Of save your reverence love  wherein thou stickst 
Up to the ears  Come  we burn daylight  ho 

Nay  thats not so 

I mean  sir  in delay 
We waste our lights in vain  like lamps by day 
Take our good meaning  for our judgment sits 
Five times in that ere once in our five wits 

And we mean well in going to this masque 
But tis no wit to go 

Why  may one ask 

I dreamd a dream tonight 

And so did I 

Well  what was yours 

That dreamers often lie 

In bed asleep  while they do dream things true 

O  then  I see  Queen Mab hath been with you 

Queen Mab  Whats she 

She is the fairies midwife  and she comes 
In shape no bigger than an agatestone 
On the forefinger of an alderman 
Drawn with a team of little atomies 
Athwart mens noses as they lie asleep 
Her waggonspokes made of long spinners legs 
The cover  of the wings of grasshoppers 
The traces  of the smallest spiders web 
The collars  of the moonshines watery beams 
Her whip  of crickets bone  the lash  of film 
Her waggoner  a small greycoated gnat 
Not half so big as a round little worm 
Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid 
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut 
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub 
Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers 
And in this state she gallops night by night 
Through lovers brains  and then they dream of love 
Oer courtiers knees  that dream on curtsies straight 
Oer lawyers fingers  who straight dream on fees 
Oer ladies lips  who straight on kisses dream 
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues 
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are 
Sometimes she gallops oer a courtiers nose 
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit 
And sometimes comes she with a tithe pigs tail 
Tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep 
Then dreams he of another benefice 
Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck 
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats 
Of breaches  ambuscadoes  Spanish bladed 
Of healths five fathom deep  and then anon 
Drums in his ear  at which he starts and wakes 
And  being thus frighted  swears a prayer or two 
And sleeps again  This is that very Mab 
That plats the manes of horses in the night 
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs 
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes 
This is the hag  when maids lie on their backs 
That presses them and learns them first to bear 
Making them women of good carriage 
This is she 

Peace  peace  Mercutio  peace 
Thou talkst of nothing 

True  I talk of dreams 
Which are the children of an idle brain 
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy 
Which is as thin of substance as the air 
And more inconstant than the wind  who woos 
Even now the frozen bosom of the north 
And  being angerd  puffs away from thence 
Turning his face to the dewdropping south 

This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves 
Supper is done  and we shall come too late 

I fear too early  for my mind misgives 
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars 
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date 
With this nights revels  and expire the term 
Of a despised life closd in my breast 
By some vile forfeit of untimely death 
But he  that hath the steerage of my course 
Direct my sail  On  lusty gentlemen 

Strike  drum 


Wheres Potpan  that he helps not to take away  he shift a trencher  he scrape a trencher 

When good manners shall lie all in one or two mens hands  and they unwashed too  tis a foul thing 

Away with the jointstools  remove the courtcupboard  look to the plate  Good thou  save me a piece of marchpane  and  as thou lovest me  let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell  Antony  and Potpan 

Ay  boy  ready 

You are looked for and called for  asked for and sought for in the great chamber 

We cannot be here and there too 

Cheerly  boys  be brisk awhile  and the longer liver take all 

Welcome  gentlemen  ladies that have their toes 
Unplagud with corns will walk a bout with you 
Ah ha  my mistresses  which of you all 
Will now deny to dance  she that makes dainty  she 
Ill swear  hath corns  am I come near ye now 
Welcome  gentlemen  I have seen the day 
That I have worn a visor  and could tell 
A whispering tale in a fair ladys ear 
Such as would please  tis gone  tis gone  tis gone 
You are welcome  gentlemen  Come  musicians  play 
A hall  a hall  give room  and foot it  girls 

More light  ye knaves  and turn the tables up 
And quench the fire  the room has grown too hot 
Ah  sirrah  this unlookdfor sport comes well 
Nay  sit  nay  sit  good cousin Capulet 
For you and I are past our dancing days 
How long is t now since last yourself and I 
Were in a mask 

Byr Lady  thirty years 

What  man  tis not so much  tis not so much 
Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio 
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will 
Some five and twenty years  and then we maskd 

Tis more  tis more  his son is older  sir 
His son is thirty 

Will you tell me that 
His son was but a ward two years ago 

What lady is that which doth enrich the hand 
Of yonder knight 

I know not  sir 

O  she doth teach the torches to burn bright 
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night 
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiops ear 
Beauty too rich for use  for earth too dear 
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows 
As yonder lady oer her fellows shows 
The measure done  Ill watch her place of stand 
And  touching hers  make blessed my rude hand 
Did my heart love till now  forswear it  sight 
For I neer saw true beauty till this night 

This  by his voice  should be a Montague 
Fetch me my rapier  boy  What  dares the slave 
Come hither  coverd with an antick face 
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity 
Now  by the stock and honour of my kin 
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin 

Why  how now  kinsman  wherefore storm you so 

Uncle  this is a Montague  our foe 
A villain that is hither come in spite 
To scorn at our solemnity this night 

Young Romeo  is it 

Tis he  that villain Romeo 

Content thee  gentle coz  let him alone 
He bears him like a portly gentleman 
And  to say truth  Verona brags of him 
To be a virtuous and wellgovernd youth 
I would not for the wealth of all this town 
Here in my house do him disparagement 
Therefore be patient  take no note of him 
It is my will  the which if thou respect 
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns 
An illbeseeming semblance for a feast 

It fits  when such a villain is a guest 
Ill not endure him 

He shall be endurd 
What  goodman boy  I say  he shall  go to 
Am I the master here  or you  go to 
Youll not endure him  God shall mend my soul 
Youll make a mutiny among my guests 
You will set cockahoop  youll be the man 

Why  uncle  tis a shame 

Go to  go to 
You are a saucy boy ist so indeed 
This trick may chance to scathe you I know what 
You must contrary me  marry  tis time 
Well said  my hearts  You are a princox  go 
Be quiet  or More light  more light For shame 
Ill make you quiet  What  cheerly  my hearts 

Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting 
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting 
I will withdraw  but this intrusion shall 
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall 


If I profane with my unworthiest hand 
This holy shrine  the gentle sin is this 
My lips  two blushing pilgrims  ready stand 
To smooth that rough touch with a tenderkiss 

Good pilgrim  you do wrong your hand too much 
Which mannerly devotion shows in this 
For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch 
And palm to palm is holy palmers kiss 

Have not saints lips  and holy palmers too 

Ay  pilgrim  lips that they must use in prayer 

O  then  dear saint  let lips do what hands do 
They pray  grant thou  lest faith turn to despair 

Saints do not move  though grant for prayers sake 

Then move not  while my prayers effect I take 
Thus from my lips  by thine  my sin is purgd 


Then have my lips the sin that they have took 

Sin from my lips  O trespass sweetly urgd 
Give me my sin again 

You kiss by the book 

Madam  your mother craves a word with you 

What is her mother 

Marry  bachelor 
Her mother is the lady of the house 
And a good lady  and a wise  and virtuous 
I nursd her daughter  that you talkd withal 
I tell you he that can lay hold of her 
Shall have the chinks 

Is she a Capulet 
O dear account  my life is my foes debt 

Away  be gone  the sport is at the best 

Ay  so I fear  the more is my unrest 

Nay  gentlemen  prepare not to be gone 
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards 
Is it een so  Why then  I thank you all 
I thank you  honest gentlemen  goodnight 
More torches here  Come on then  lets to bed 
Ah  sirrah  by my fay  it waxes late 
Ill to my rest 


Come hither  nurse  What is yond gentleman 

The son and heir of old Tiberio 

Whats he that now is going out of door 

Marry  that  I think  be young Petruchio 

Whats he  that follows there  that would not dance 

I know not 

Go  ask his name If he be married 
My grave is like to be my wedding bed 

His name is Romeo  and a Montague 
The only son of your great enemy 

My only love sprung from my only hate 
Too early seen unknown  and known too late 
Prodigious birth of love it is to me 
That I must love a loathed enemy 

Whats this  whats this 

A rime I learnd even now 
Of one I dancd withal 


Anon  anon 
Come  lets away  the strangers are all gone 

Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie 
And young affection gapes to be his heir 
That fair for which love groand for and would die 
With tender Juliet matchd  is now not fair 
Now Romeo is belovd and loves again 
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks 
But to his foe supposd he must complain 
And she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks 
Being held a foe  he may not have access 
To breathe such vows as lovers usd to swear 
And she as much in love  her means much less 
To meet her newbeloved any where 
But passion lends them power  time means  to meet 
Tempering extremity with extreme sweet 

Can I go forward when my heart is here 
Turn back  dull earth  and find thy centre out 

Romeo  my cousin Romeo 

He is wise 
And  on my life  hath stoln him home to bed 

He ran this way  and leapd this orchard wall 
Call  good Mercutio 

Nay  Ill conjure too 
Romeo  humours  madman  passion  lover 
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh 
Speak but one rime and I am satisfied 
Cry but Ay me  couple but love and dove  
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word 
One nickname for her purblind son and heir 
Young Adam Cupid  he that shot so trim 
When King Cophetua lovd the beggarmaid 
He heareth not  he stirreth not  he moveth not 
The ape is dead  and I must conjure him 
I conjure thee by Rosalines bright eyes 
By her high forehead  and her scarlet lip 
By her fine foot  straight leg  and quivering thigh 
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie 
That in thy likeness thou appear to us 

An if he hear thee  thou wilt anger him 

This cannot anger him  twould anger him 
To raise a spirit in his mistress circle 
Of some strange nature  letting it there stand 
Till she had laid it  and conjurd it down 
That were some spite  my invocation 
Is fair and honest  and in his mistress name 
I conjure only but to raise up him 

Come  he hath hid himself among these trees 
To be consorted with the humorous night 
Blind is his love and best befits the dark 

If love be blind  love cannot hit the mark 
Now will he sit under a medlar tree 
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit 
As maids call medlars  when they laugh alone 
O Romeo  that she were  O  that she were 
An open et c tera  thou a poperin pear 
Romeo  good night  Ill to my trucklebed 
This fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep 
Come  shall we go 

Go  then  for tis in vain 
To seek him here that means not to be found 


He jests at scars  that never felt a wound 

But  soft  what light through yonder window breaks 
It is the east  and Juliet is the sun 
Arise  fair sun  and kill the envious moon 
Who is already sick and pale with grief 
That thou her maid art far more fair than she 
Be not her maid  since she is envious 
Her vestal livery is but sick and green 
And none but fools do wear it  cast it off 
It is my lady  O  it is my love 
O  that she knew she were 
She speaks  yet she says nothing  what of that 
Her eye discourses  I will answer it 
I am too bold  tis not to me she speaks 
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven 
Having some business  do entreat her eyes 
To twinkle in their spheres till they return 
What if her eyes were there  they in her head 
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars 
As daylight doth a lamp  her eyes in heaven 
Would through the airy region stream so bright 
That birds would sing and think it were not night 
See  how she leans her cheek upon her hand 
O  that I were a glove upon that hand 
That I might touch that cheek 

Ay me 

She speaks 
O  speak again  bright angel  for thou art 
As glorious to this night  being oer my head 
As is a winged messenger of heaven 
Unto the whiteupturned wondring eyes 
Of mortals  that fall back to gaze on him 
When he bestrides the lazypacing clouds 
And sails upon the bosom of the air 

O Romeo  Romeo  wherefore art thou Romeo 
Deny thy father  and refuse thy name 
Or  if thou wilt not  be but sworn my love 
And Ill no longer be a Capulet 

Shall I hear more  or shall I speak at this 

Tis but thy name that is my enemy 
Thou art thyself though  not a Montague 
Whats Montague  it is nor hand  nor foot 
Nor arm  nor face  nor any other part 
Belonging to a man  O  be some other name 
Whats in a name  that which we call a rose 
By any other name would smell as sweet 
So Romeo would  were he not Romeo calld 
Retain that dear perfection which he owes 
Without that title  Romeo  doff thy name 
And for that name  which is no part of thee 
Take all myself 

I take thee at thy word 
Call me but love  and Ill be new baptizd 
Henceforth I never will be Romeo 

What man art thou  that  thus bescreend in night 
So stumblest on my counsel 

By a name 
I know not how to tall thee who I am 
My name  dear saint  is hateful to myself 
Because it is an enemy to thee 
Had I it written  I would tear the word 

My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words 
Of that tongues uttering  yet I know the sound 
Art thou not Romeo  and a Montague 

Neither  fair maid  if either thee dislike 

How camst thou hither  tell me  and wherefore 
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
And the place death  considering who thou art 
If any of my kinsmen find thee here 

With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls 
For stony limits cannot hold love out 
And what love can do that dares love attempt 
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me 

If they do see thee they will murder thee 

Alack  there lies more peril in thine eye 
Than twenty of their swords  look thou but sweet 
And I am proof against their enmity 

I would not for the world they saw thee here 

I have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes 
And but thou love me  let them find me here 
My life were better ended by their hate 
Than death prorogued  wanting of thy love 

By whose direction foundst thou out this place 

By Love  that first did prompt me to inquire 
He lent me counsel  and I lent him eyes 
I am no pilot  yet  wert thou as far 
As that vast shore washd with the furthest sea 
I would adventure for such merchandise 

Thou knowst the mask of night is on my face 
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek 
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight 
Fain would I dwell on form  fain  fain deny 
What I have spoke  but farewell compliment 
Dost thou love me  I know thou wilt say Ay  
And I will take thy word  yet  if thou swearst 
Thou mayst prove false  at lovers perjuries 
They say  Jove laughs  O gentle Romeo 
If thou dost love  pronounce it faithfully 
Or if thou thinkst I am too quickly won 
Ill frown and be perverse and say thee nay 
So thou wilt woo  but else  not for the world 
In truth  fair Montague  I am too fond 
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light 
But trust me  gentleman  Ill prove more true 
Than those that have more cunning to be strange 
I should have been more strange  I must confess 
But that thou overheardst  ere I was ware 
My true loves passion  therefore pardon me 
And not impute this yielding to light love 
Which the dark night hath so discovered 

Lady  by yonder blessed moon I swear 
That tips with silver all these fruittree tops 

O  swear not by the moon  the inconstant moon 
That monthly changes in her circled orb 
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable 

What shall I swear by 

Do not swear at all 
Or  if thou wilt  swear by thy gracious self 
Which is the god of my idolatry 
And Ill believe thee 

If my hearts dear love 

Well  do not swear  Although I joy in thee 
I have no joy of this contract tonight 
It is too rash  too unadvisd  too sudden 
Too like the lightning  which doth cease to be 
Ere one can say it lightens  Sweet  goodnight 
This bud of love  by summers ripening breath 
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet 
Goodnight  goodnight  as sweet repose and rest 
Come to thy heart as that within my breast 

O  wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied 

What satisfaction canst thou have tonight 

The exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine 

I gave thee mine before thou didst request it 
And yet I would it were to give again 

Wouldst thou withdraw it  for what purpose  love 

But to be frank  and give it thee again 
And yet I wish but for the thing I have 
My bounty is as boundless as the sea 
My love as deep  the more I give to thee 
The more I have  for both are infinite 

I hear some noise within  dear love  adieu 
Anon  good nurse  Sweet Montague  be true 
Stay but a little  I will come again 


O blessed  blessed night  I am afeard 
Being in night  all this is but a dream 
Too flatteringsweet to be substantial 


Three words  dear Romeo  and goodnight indeed 
If that thy bent of love be honourable 
Thy purpose marriage  send me word tomorrow 
By one that Ill procure to come to thee 
Where  and what time  thou wilt perform the rite 
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay 
And follow thee my lord throughout the world 

Madam 

I come  anon But if thou meanst not well 
I do beseech thee 

Madam 

By and by  I come 
To cease thy suit  and leave me to my grief 
Tomorrow will I send 

So thrive my soul 

A thousand times goodnight 


A thousand times the worse  to want thy light 
Love goes toward love  as schoolboys from their books 
But love from love  toward school with heavy looks 

Hist  Romeo  hist  O  for a falconers voice 
To lure this tasselgentle back again 
Bondage is hoarse  and may not speak aloud 
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies 
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine 
With repetition of my Romeos name 

It is my soul that calls upon my name 
How silversweet sound lovers tongues by night 
Like softest music to attending ears 

Romeo 

My dear 

At what oclock tomorrow 
Shall I send to thee 

At the hour of nine 

I will not fail  tis twenty years till then 
I have forgot why I did call thee back 

Let me stand here till thou remember it 

I shall forget  to have thee still stand there 
Remembering how I love thy company 

And Ill still stay  to have thee still forget 
Forgetting any other home but this 

Tis almost morning  I would have thee gone 
And yet no further than a wantons bird 
Who lets it hop a little from her hand 
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves 
And with a silk thread plucks it back again 
So lovingjealous of his liberty 

I would I were thy bird 

Sweet  so would I 
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing 
Goodnight  goodnight  parting is such sweet sorrow 
That I shall say goodnight till it be morrow 


Sleep dwell upon thine eyes  peace in thy breast 
Would I were sleep and peace  so sweet to rest 
Hence will I to my ghostly fathers cell 
His help to crave  and my dear hap to tell 


The greyeyd morn smiles on the frowning night 
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light 
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels 
From forth days path and Titans fiery wheels 
Now  ere the sun advance his burning eye 
The day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry 
I must upfill this osier cage of ours 
With baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers 
The earth thats natures mother is her tomb 
What is her burying grave that is her womb 
And from her womb children of divers kind 
We sucking on her natural bosom find 
Many for many virtues excellent 
None but for some  and yet all different 
O  mickle is the powerful grace that lies 
In herbs  plants  stones  and their true qualities 
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live 
But to the earth some special good doth give 
Nor aught so good but straind from that fair use 
Revolts from true birth  stumbling on abuse 
Virtue itself turns vice  being misapplied 
And vice sometimes by action dignified 
Within the infant rind of this weak flower 
Poison hath residence and medicine power 
For this  being smelt  with that part cheers each part 
Being tasted  slays all senses with the heart 
Two such opposed foes encamp them still 
In man as well as herbs  grace and rude will 
And where the worser is predominant 
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant 


Good morrow  father 

Benedicite 
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me 
Young son  it argues a distemperd head 
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed 
Care keeps his watch in every old mans eye 
And where care lodges  sleep will never lie 
But where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain 
Doth couch his limbs  there golden sleep doth reign 
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure 
Thou art uprousd by some distemperature 
Or if not so  then here I hit it right 
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight 

That last is true  the sweeter rest was mine 

God pardon sin  wast thou with Rosaline 

With Rosaline  my ghostly father  no 
I have forgot that name  and that names woe 

Thats my good son  but where hast thou been  then 

Ill tell thee  ere thou ask it me again 
I have been feasting with mine enemy 
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me 
Thats by me wounded  both our remedies 
Within thy help and holy physic lies 
I bear no hatred  blessed man  for  lo 
My intercession likewise steads my foe 

Be plain  good son  and homely in thy drift 
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift 

Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set 
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet 
As mine on hers  so hers is set on mine 
And all combind  save what thou must combine 
By holy marriage  when and where and how 
We met we wood and made exchange of vow 
Ill tell thee as we pass  but this I pray 
That thou consent to marry us today 

Holy Saint Francis  what a change is here 
Is Rosaline  whom thou didst love so dear 
So soon forsaken  young mens love then lies 
Not truly in their hearts  but in their eyes 
Jesu Maria  what a deal of brine 
Hath washd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline 
How much salt water thrown away in waste 
To season love  that of it doth not taste 
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears 
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears 
Lo  here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit 
Of an old tear that is not washd off yet 
If eer thou wast thyself and these woes thine 
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline 
And art thou changd  pronounce this sentence then 
Women may fall  when theres no strength in men 

Thou chiddst me oft for loving Rosaline 

For doting  not for loving  pupil mine 

And badst me bury love 

Not in a grave 
To lay one in  another out to have 

I pray thee  chide not  she  whom I love now 
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow 
The other did not so 

O  she knew well 
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell 
But come  young waverer  come  go with me 
In one respect Ill thy assistant be 
For this alliance may so happy prove 
To turn your households rancour to pure love 

O  let us hence  I stand on sudden haste 

Wisely and slow  they stumble that run fast 


Where the devil should this Romeo be 
Came he not home tonight 

Not to his fathers  I spoke with his man 

Why that same pale hardhearted wench  that Rosaline 
Torments him so  that he will sure run mad 

Tybalt  the kinsman of old Capulet 
Hath sent a letter to his fathers house 

A challenge  on my life 

Romeo will answer it 

Any man that can write may answer a letter 

Nay  he will answer the letters master  how he dares  being dared 

Alas  poor Romeo  he is already dead  stabbed with a white wenchs black eye  shot through the ear with a lovesong  the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bowboys buttshaft  and is he a man to encounter Tybalt 

Why  what is Tybalt 

More than prince of cats  I can tell you  O  he is the courageous captain of compliments  He fights as you sing pricksong  keeps time  distance  and proportion  rests me his minim rest  one  two  and the third in your bosom  the very butcher of a silk button  a duellist  a duellist  a gentleman of the very first house  of the first and second cause  Ah  the immortal passado  the punto reverso  the hay 

The what 

The pox of such antick  lisping  affecting fantasticoes  these new tuners of accents By Jesu  a very good blade a very tall man  a very good whore  Why  is not this a lamentable thing  grandsire  that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies  these fashionmongers  these pardonnezmois  who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench  O  their bons  their bons 


Here comes Romeo  here comes Romeo 

Without his roe  like a dried herring  O flesh  flesh  how art thou fishified  Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in  Laura to his lady was but a kitchenwench  marry  she had a better love to berime her  Dido a dowdy  Cleopatra a gipsy  Helen and Hero hildings and harlots  Thisbe  a grey eye or so  but not to the purpose  Signior Romeo  bon jour  theres a French salutation to your French slop  You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night 

Good morrow to you both  What counterfeit did I give you 

The slip  sir  the slip  can you not conceive 

Pardon  good Mercutio  my business was great  and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy 

Thats as much as to say  such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams 

Meaning to curtsy 

Thou hast most kindly hit it 

A most courteous exposition 

Nay  I am the very pink of courtesy 

Pink for flower 

Right 

Why  then  is my pump well flowered 

Well said  follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out the pump  that  when the single sole of it is worn  the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular 

O singlesoled jest  solely singular for the singleness 

Come between us  good Benvolio  my wit faints 

Switch and spurs  switch and spurs  or Ill cry a match 

Nay  if thy wits run the wildgoose chase  I have done  for thou hast more of the wildgoose in one of thy wits than  I am sure  I have in my whole five  Was I with you there for the goose 

Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not here for the goose 

I will bite thee by the ear for that jest 

Nay  good goose  bite not 

Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting  it is a most sharp sauce 

And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose 

O  heres a wit of cheveril  that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad 

I stretch it out for that word broad  which added to the goose  proves thee far and wide a broad goose 

Why  is not this better now than groaning for love  now art thou sociable  now art thou Romeo  now art thou what thou art  by art as well as by nature  for this drivelling love is like a great natural  that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole 

Stop there  stop there 

Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair 

Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large 

O  thou art deceived  I would have made it short  for I was come to the whole depth of my tale  and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer 

Heres goodly gear 


A sail  a sail 

Two  two  a shirt and a smock

My fan  Peter 

Good Peter  to hide her face  for her fans the fairer face 

God ye good morrow  gentlemen 

God ye good den  fair gentlewoman 

Is it good den 

Tis no less  I tell you  for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon 

Out upon you  what a man are you 

One  gentlewoman  that God hath made for himself to mar 

By my troth  it is well said  for himself to mar  quoth a Gentlemen  can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo 

I can tell you  but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him  I am the youngest of that name  for fault of a worse 

You say well 

Yea  is the worst well  very well took  i faith  wisely  wisely 

If you be he  sir  I desire some confidence with you 

She will indite him to some supper 

A bawd  a bawd  a bawd  So ho 

What hast thou found 

No hare  sir  unless a hare  sir  in a lenten pie  that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent 


An old hare hoar  and an old hare hoar 
Is very good meat in Lent 
But a hare that is hoar  is too much for a score 
When it hoars ere it be spent 

Romeo  will you come to your fathers  well to dinner thither 

I will follow you 

Farewell  ancient lady  farewell  Lady  lady  lady 


Marry  farewell  I pray you  sir  what saucy merchant was this  that was so full of his ropery 

A gentleman  nurse  that loves to hear himself talk  and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month 

An a speak anything against me  Ill take him down  an a were lustier than he is  and twenty such Jacks  and if I cannot  Ill find those that shall  Scurvy knave  I am none of his flirtgills  I am none of his skeinsmates 

And thou must stand by too  and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure 

I saw no man use you at his pleasure  if I had  my weapon should quickly have been out  I warrant you  I dare draw as soon as another man  if I see occasion in a good quarrel  and the law on my side 

Now  afore God  I am so vexed  that every part about me quivers  Scurvy knave  Pray you  sir  a word  and as I told you  my young lady bade me inquire you out  what she bid me say I will keep to myself  but first let me tell ye  if ye should lead her into a fools paradise  as they say  it were a very gross kind of behaviour  as they say  for the gentlewoman is young  and  therefore  if you should deal double with her  truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman  and very weak dealing 

Nurse  commend me to thy lady and mistress  I protest unto thee 

Good heart  and i faith  I will tell her as much  Lord  Lord  she will be a joyful woman 

What wilt thou tell her  nurse  thou dost not mark me 

I will tell her  sir  that you do protest  which  as I take it  is a gentlemanlike offer 

Bid her devise 
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon 
And there she shall at Friar Laurence cell 
Be shrivd and married  Here is for thy pains 

No  truly  sir  not a penny 

Go to  I say  you shall 

This afternoon  sir  well  she shall be there 

And stay  good nurse  behind the abbey wall 
Within this hour my man shall be with thee 
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair 
Which to the high topgallant of my joy 
Must be my convoy in the secret night 
Farewell  Be trusty  and Ill quit thy pains 
Farewell  Commend me to thy mistress 

Now God in heaven bless thee  Hark you  sir 

What sayst thou  my dear nurse 

Is your man secret  Did you neer hear say 
Two may keep counsel  putting one away 

I warrant thee my mans as true as steel 

Well  sir  my mistress is the sweetest lady Lord  Lord when twas a little prating thing O  theres a nobleman in town  one Paris  that would fain lay knife aboard  but she  good soul  had as lief see a toad  a very toad  as see him  I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man  but  Ill warrant you  when I say so  she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world  Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter 

Ay  nurse  what of that  both with an R 

Ah  mocker  thats the dogs name  R is for the No  I know it begins with some other letter  and she had the prettiest sententious of it  of you and rosemary  that it would do you good to hear it 

Commend me to thy lady 

Ay  a thousand times

Anon 

Before  and apace 


The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse 
In half an hour she promisd to return 
Perchance she cannot meet him  thats not so 
O  she is lame  loves heralds should be thoughts 
Which ten times faster glide than the suns beams 
Driving back shadows over lowering hills 
Therefore do nimblepiniond doves draw Love 
And therefore hath the windswift Cupid wings 
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill 
Of this days journey  and from nine till twelve 
Is three long hours  yet she is not come 
Had she affections  and warm youthful blood 
Shed be as swift in motion as a ball 
My words would bandy her to my sweet love 
And his to me 
But old folks  many feign as they were dead 
Unwieldy  slow  heavy and pale as lead 


O God  she comes  O honey nurse  what news 

Hast thou met with him  Send thy man away 

Peter  stay at the gate 


Now  good sweet nurse  O Lord  why lookst thou sad 
Though news be sad  yet tell them merrily 
If good  thou shamst the music of sweet news 
By playing it to me with so sour a face 

I am aweary  give me leave awhile 
Fie  how my bones ache  What a jaunce have I had 

I would thou hadst my bones  and I thy news 
Nay  come  I pray thee  speak  good  good nurse  speak 

Jesu  what haste  can you not stay awhile 
Do you not see that I am out of breath 

How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath 
To say to me that thou art out of breath 
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay 
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse 
Is thy news good  or bad  answer to that 
Say either  and Ill stay the circumstance 
Let me be satisfied  is t good or bad 

Well  you have made a simple choice  you know not how to choose a man  Romeo  no  not he  though his face be better than any mans  yet his leg excels all mens  and for a hand  and a foot  and a body  though they be not to be talked on  yet they are past compare  He is not the flower of courtesy  but  Ill warrant him  as gentle as a lamb  Go thy ways  wench  serve God  What  have you dined at home 

No  no  but all this did I know before 
What says he of our marriage  what of that 

Lord  how my head aches  what a head have I 
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces 
My back o tother side  O  my back  my back 
Beshrew your heart for sending me about 
To catch my death with jauncing up and down 

I faith  I am sorry that thou art not well 
Sweet  sweet  sweet nurse  tell me  what says my love 

Your love says  like an honest gentleman  and a courteous  and a kind  and a handsome  and  I warrant  a virtuous Where is your mother 

Where is my mother  why  she is within 
Where should she be  How oddly thou repliest 
Your love says  like an honest gentleman 
Where is your mother  

O  Gods lady dear 
Are you so hot  Marry  come up  I trow 
Is this the poultice for my aching bones 
Henceforward do your messages yourself 

Heres such a coil  come  what says Romeo 

Have you got leave to go to shrift today 

I have 

Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence cell 
There stays a husband to make you a wife 
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks 
Theyll be in scarlet straight at any news 
Hie you to church  I must another way 
To fetch a ladder  by the which your love 
Must climb a birds nest soon when it is dark 
I am the drudge and toil in your delight 
But you shall bear the burden soon at night 
Go  Ill to dinner  hie you to the cell 

Hie to high fortune  Honest nurse  farewell 


So smile the heaven upon this holy act 
That after hours with sorrow chide us not 

Amen  amen  but come what sorrow can 
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy 
That one short minute gives me in her sight 
Do thou but close our hands with holy words 
Then lovedevouring death do what he dare 
It is enough I may but call her mine 

These violent delights have violent ends 
And in their triumph die  like fire and powder 
Which  as they kiss consume  the sweetest honey 
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness 
And in the taste confounds the appetite 
Therefore love moderately  long love doth so 
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow 


Here comes the lady  O  so light a foot 
Will neer wear out the everlasting flint 
A lover may bestride the gossamer 
That idles in the wanton summer air 

And yet not fall  so light is vanity 

Good even to my ghostly confessor 

Romeo shall thank thee  daughter  for us both 

As much to him  else are his thanks too much 

Ah  Juliet  if the measure of thy joy 
Be heapd like mine  and that thy skill be more 
To blazon it  then sweeten with thy breath 
This neighbour air  and let rich musics tongue 
Unfold the imagind happiness that both 
Receive in either by this dear encounter 

Conceit  more rich in matter than in words 
Brags of his substance  not of ornament 
They are but beggars that can count their worth 
But my true love is grown to such excess 
I cannot sum up half my sum of wealth 

Come  come with me  and we will make short work 
For  by your leaves  you shall not stay alone 
Till holy church incorporate two in one 


I pray thee  good Mercutio  lets retire 
The day is hot  the Capulets abroad 
And  if we meet  we shall not scape a brawl 
For now  these hot days  is the mad blood stirring 

Thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says  God send me no need of thee  and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer  when  indeed  there is no need 

Am I like such a fellow 

Come  come  thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy  and as soon moved to be moody  and as soon moody to be moved 

And what to 

Nay  an there were two such  we should have none shortly  for one would kill the other  Thou  why  thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast  Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts  having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes  What eye  but such an eye  would spy out such a quarrel  Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat  and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling  Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street  because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun  Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter  with another  for tying his new shoes with old riband  and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling 

An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art  any man should buy the feesimple of my life for an hour and a quarter 

The feesimple  O simple 

By my head  here come the Capulets 

By my heel  I care not 


Follow me close  for I will speak to them  Gentlemen  good den  a word with one of you 

And but one word with one of us  Couple it with something  make it a word and a blow 

You shall find me apt enough to that  sir  an you will give me occasion 

Could you not take some occasion without giving 

Mercutio  thou consortst with Romeo 

Consort  What  dost thou make us minstrels  an thou make minstrels of us  look to hear nothing but discords  heres my fiddlestick  heres that shall make you dance  Zounds  consort 

We talk here in the public haunt of men 
Either withdraw unto some private place 
Or reason coldly of your grievances 
Or else depart  here all eyes gaze on us 

Mens eyes were made to look  and let them gaze 
I will not budge for no mans pleasure  I 


Well  peace be with you  sir  Here comes my man 

But Ill be hangd  sir  if he wear your livery 
Marry  go before to field  hell be your follower 
Your worship in that sense may call him man  

Romeo  the hate I bear thee can afford 
No better term than this thou art a villain 

Tybalt  the reason that I have to love thee 
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage 
To such a greeting  villain am I none 
Therefore farewell  I see thou knowst me not 

Boy  this shall not excuse the injuries 
That thou hast done me  therefore turn and draw 

I do protest I never injurd thee 
But love thee better than thou canst devise 
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love 
And so  good Capulet  which name I tender 
As dearly as my own  be satisfied 

O calm  dishonourable  vile submission 
Alla stoccata carries it away 

Tybalt  you ratcatcher  will you walk 

What wouldst thou have with me 

Good king of cats  nothing but one of your nine lives  that I mean to make bold withal  and  as you shall use me hereafter  drybeat the rest of the eight  Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears  make haste  lest mine be about your ears ere it be out 

I am for you 

Gentle Mercutio  put thy rapier up 

Come  sir  your passado 


Draw  Benvolio  beat down their weapons 
Gentlemen  for shame  forbear this outrage 
Tybalt  Mercutio  the prince expressly hath 
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets 
Hold  Tybalt  good Mercutio 


I am hurt 
A plague o both your houses  I am sped 
Is he gone  and hath nothing 

What  art thou hurt 

Ay  ay  a scratch  a scratch  marry  tis enough 
Where is my page  Go  villain  fetch a surgeon 


Courage  man  the hurt cannot be much 

No  tis not so deep as a well  nor so wide as a church door  but tis enough  twill serve  ask for me tomorrow  and you shall find me a grave man  I am peppered  I warrant  for this world  A plague o both your houses  Zounds  a dog  a rat  a mouse  a cat  to scratch a man to death  a braggart  a rogue  a villain  that fights by the book of arithmetic  Why the devil came you between us  I was hurt under your arm 

I thought all for the best 

Help me into some house  Benvolio 
Or I shall faint  A plague o both your houses 
They have made worms meat of me  I have it 
And soundly too your houses 


This gentleman  the princes near ally 
My very friend  hath got his mortal hurt 
In my behalf  my reputation staind 
With Tybalts slander  Tybalt  that an hour 
Hath been my kinsman  O sweet Juliet 
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate 
And in my temper softend valours steel 


O Romeo  Romeo  brave Mercutios dead 
That gallant spirit hath aspird the clouds 
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth 

This days black fate on more days doth depend 
This but begins the woe others must end 


Here comes the furious Tybalt back again 

Alive  in triumph  and Mercutio slain 
Away to heaven  respective lenity 
And fireeyd fury be my conduct now 
Now  Tybalt  take the villain back again 
That late thou gavst me  for Mercutios soul 
Is but a little way above our heads 
Staying for thine to keep him company 
Either thou  or I  or both  must go with him 

Thou wretched boy  that didst consort him here 
Shalt with him hence 

This shall determine that 


Romeo  away  be gone 
The citizens are up  and Tybalt slain 
Stand not amazd  the prince will doom thee death 
If thou art taken  hence  be gone  away 

O  I am Fortunes fool 

Why dost thou stay 

Which way ran he that killd Mercutio 
Tybalt  that murderer  which way ran he 

There lies that Tybalt 

Up  sir  go with me 
I charge thee in the princes name  obey 


Where are the vile beginners of this fray 

O noble prince  I can discover all 
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl 
There lies the man  slain by young Romeo 
That slew thy kinsman  brave Mercutio 

Tybalt  my cousin  O my brothers child 
O prince  O cousin  husband  O  the blood is spilld 
Of my dear kinsman  Prince  as thou art true 
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague 
O cousin  cousin 

Benvolio  who began this bloody fray 

Tybalt  here slain  whom Romeos hand did slay 
Romeo  that spoke him fair  bade him bethink 
How nice the quarrel was  and urgd withal 
Your high displeasure  all this  uttered 
With gentle breath  calm look  knees humbly bowd 
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen 
Of Tybalt deaf to peace  but that he tilts 
With piercing steel at bold Mercutios breast 
Who  all as hot  turns deadly point to point 
And  with a martial scorn  with one hand beats 
Cold death aside  and with the other sends 
It back to Tybalt  whose dexterity 
Retorts it  Romeo he cries aloud 
Hold  friends  friends  part  and  swifter than his tongue 
His agile arm beats down their fatal points 
And twixt them rushes  underneath whose arm 
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life 
Of stout Mercutio  and then Tybalt fled 
But by and by comes back to Romeo 
Who had but newly entertaind revenge 
And to t they go like lightning  for  ere I 
Could draw to part them  was stout Tybalt slain 
And  as he fell  did Romeo turn and fly 
This is the truth  or let Benvolio die 

He is a kinsman to the Montague 
Affection makes him false  he speaks not true 
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife 
And all those twenty could but kill one life 
I beg for justice  which thou  prince  must give 
Romeo slew Tybalt  Romeo must not live 

Romeo slew him  he slew Mercutio 
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe 

Not Romeo  prince  he was Mercutios friend 
His fault concludes but what the law should end 
The life of Tybalt 

And for that offence 
Immediately we do exile him hence 
I have an interest in your hates proceeding 
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding 
But Ill amerce you with so strong a fine 
That you shall all repent the loss of mine 
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses 
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses 
Therefore use none  let Romeo hence in haste 
Else  when hes found  that hour is his last 
Bear hence this body and attend our will 
Mercy but murders  pardoning those that kill 


Gallop apace  you fieryfooted steeds 
Towards Ph bus lodging  such a waggoner 
As Ph thon would whip you to the west 
And bring in cloudy night immediately 
Spread thy close curtain  loveperforming night 
That runaways eyes may wink  and Romeo 
Leap to these arms  untalkd of and unseen 
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites 
By their own beauties  or  if love be blind 
It best agrees with night  Come  civil night 
Thou sobersuited matron  all in black 
And learn me how to lose a winning match 
Playd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods 
Hood my unmannd blood  bating in my cheeks 
With thy black mantle  till strange love  grown bold 
Think true love acted simple modesty 
Come  night  come  Romeo  come  thou day in night 
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night 
Whiter than new snow on a ravens back 
Come  gentle night  come  loving  blackbrowd night 
Give me my Romeo  and  when he shall die 
Take him and cut him out in little stars 
And he will make the face of heaven so fine 
That all the world will be in love with night 
And pay no worship to the garish sun 
O  I have bought the mansion of a love 
But not possessd it  and  though I am sold 
Not yet enjoyd  So tedious is this day 
As is the night before some festival 
To an impatient child that hath new robes 
And may not wear them  O  here comes my nurse 


And she brings news  and every tongue that speaks 
But Romeos name speaks heavenly eloquence 
Now nurse  what news  What hast thou there  the cords 

That Romeo bade thee fetch 

Ay  ay  the cords 


Ah me  what news  why dost thou wring thy hands 

Ah welladay  hes dead  hes dead  hes dead 
We are undone  lady  we are undone 
Alack the day  hes gone  hes killed  hes dead 

Can heaven be so envious 

Romeo can 
Though heaven cannot  O  Romeo  Romeo 
Who ever would have thought it  Romeo 

What devil art thou that dost torment me thus 
This torture should be roard in dismal hell 
Hath Romeo slain himself  say thou but I  
And that bare vowel  I  shall poison more 
Than the deathdarting eye of cockatrice 
I am not I  if there be such an I  
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer I  
If he be slain  say I  or if not no  
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe 

I saw the wound  I saw it with mine eyes 
God save the mark  here on his manly breast 
A piteous corse  a bloody piteous corse 
Pale  pale as ashes  all bedaubd in blood 
All in gore blood  I swounded at the sight 

O break  my heart poor bankrupt  break at once 
To prison  eyes  neer look on liberty 
Vile earth  to earth resign  end motion here 
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier 

O Tybalt  Tybalt  the best friend I had 
O courteous Tybalt  honest gentleman 
That ever I should live to see thee dead 

What storm is this that blows so contrary 
Is Romeo slaughterd  and is Tybalt dead 
My dearest cousin  and my dearer lord 
Then  dreadful trumpet  sound the general doom 
For who is living if those two are gone 

Tybalt is gone  and Romeo banished 
Romeo  that killd him  he is banished 

O God  did Romeos hand shed Tybalts blood 

It did  it did  alas the day  it did 

O serpent heart  hid with a flowering face 
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave 
Beautiful tyrant  fiend angelical 
Dovefeatherd raven  wolvishravening lamb 
Despised substance of divinest show 
Just opposite to what thou justly seemst 
A damned saint  an honourable villain 
O  nature  what hadst thou to do in hell 
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend 
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh 
Was ever book containing such vile matter 
So fairly bound  O  that deceit should dwell 
In such a gorgeous palace 

Theres no trust 
No faith  no honesty in men  all naught 
All perjurd  all dissemblers  all forsworn 
Ah  wheres my man  give me some aqua vit 
These griefs  these woes  these sorrows make me old 
Shame come to Romeo 

Blisterd be thy tongue 
For such a wish  he was not born to shame 
Upon his brow shame is ashamd to sit 
For tis a throne where honour may be crownd 
Sole monarch of the universal earth 
O  what a beast was I to chide at him 

Will you speak well of him that killd your cousin 

Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband 
Ah  poor my lord  what tongue shall smooth thy name 
When I  thy threehours wife  have mangled it 
But  wherefore  villain  didst thou kill my cousin 
That villain cousin would have killd my husband 
Back  foolish tears  back to your native spring 
Your tributary drops belong to woe 
Which you  mistaking  offer up to joy 
My husband lives  that Tybalt would have slain 
And Tybalts dead  that would have slain my husband 
All this is comfort  wherefore weep I then 
Some word there was  worser than Tybalts death 
That murderd me  I would forget it fain 
But O  it presses to my memory 
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds 
Tybalt is dead  and Romeo banished  
That banished  that one word banished  
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts  Tybalts death 
Was woe enough  if it had ended there 
Or  if sour woe delights in fellowship 
And needly will be rankd with other griefs 
Why followd not  when she said Tybalts dead  
Thy father  or thy mother  nay  or both 
Which modern lamentation might have movd 
But with a rearward following Tybalts death 
Romeo is banished  to speak that word 
Is father  mother  Tybalt  Romeo  Juliet 
All slain  all dead  Romeo is banished  
There is no end  no limit  measure  bound 
In that words death  no words can that woe sound 
Where is my father and my mother  nurse 

Weeping and wailing over Tybalts corse 
Will you go to them  I will bring you thither 

Wash they his wounds with tears  mine shall be spent 
When theirs are dry  for Romeos banishment 
Take up those cords  Poor ropes  you are beguild 
Both you and I  for Romeo is exild 
He made you for a highway to my bed 
But I  a maid  die maidenwidowed 
Come  cords  come  nurse  Ill to my wedding bed 
And death  not Romeo  take my maidenhead 

Hie to your chamber  Ill find Romeo 
To comfort you  I wot well where he is 
Hark ye  your Romeo will be here tonight 
Ill to him  he is hid at Laurence cell 

O  find him  give this ring to my true knight 
And bid him come to take his last farewell 


Romeo  come forth  come forth  thou fearful man 
Affliction is enamourd of thy parts 
And thou art wedded to calamity 


Father  what news  what is the princes doom 
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand 
That I yet know not 

Too familiar 
Is my dear son with such sour company 
I bring thee tidings of the princes doom 

What less than doomsday is the princes doom 

A gentler judgment vanishd from his lips 
Not bodys death  but bodys banishment 

Ha  banishment  be merciful  say death  
For exile hath more terror in his look 
Much more than death  do not say banishment  

Hence from Verona art thou banished 
Be patient  for the world is broad and wide 

There is no world without Verona walls 
But purgatory  torture  hell itself 
Hence banished is banishd from the world 
And worlds exile is death  then banished  
Is death mistermd  Calling death banished  
Thou cuttst my head off with a golden axe 
And smilst upon the stroke that murders me 

O deadly sin  O rude unthankfulness 
Thy fault our law calls death  but the kind prince 
Taking thy part  hath rushd aside the law 
And turnd that black word death to banishment 
This is dear mercy  and thou seest it not 

Tis torture  and not mercy  heaven is here 
Where Juliet lives  and every cat and dog 
And little mouse  every unworthy thing 
Live here in heaven and may look on her 
But Romeo may not  more validity 
More honourable state  more courtship lives 
In carrion flies than Romeo  they may seize 
On the white wonder of dear Juliets hand 
And steal immortal blessing from her lips 
Who  even in pure and vestal modesty 
Still blush  as thinking their own kisses sin 
Flies may do this  but I from this must fly 
They are free men  but I am banished 
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death 
Hadst thou no poison mixd  no sharpground knife 
No sudden mean of death  though neer so mean 
But banished to kill me  Banished  
O friar  the damned use that word in hell 
Howlings attend it  how hast thou the heart 
Being a divine  a ghostly confessor 
A sinabsolver  and my friend professd 
To mangle me with that word banished  

Thou fond mad man  hear me but speak a word 

O  thou wilt speak again of banishment 

Ill give thee armour to keep off that word 
Adversitys sweet milk  philosophy 
To comfort thee  though thou art banished 

Yet banished  Hang up philosophy 
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet 
Displant a town  reverse a princes doom 
It helps not  it prevails not  talk no more 

O  then I see that madmen have no ears 

How should they  when that wise men have no eyes 

Let me dispute with thee of thy estate 

Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel 
Wert thou as young as I  Juliet thy love 
An hour but married  Tybalt murdered 
Doting like me  and like me banished 
Then mightst thou speak  then mightst thou tear thy hair 
And fall upon the ground  as I do now 
Taking the measure of an unmade grave 


Arise  one knocks  good Romeo  hide thyself 

Not I  unless the breath of heartsick groans 
Mistlike  infold me from the search of eyes 


Hark  how they knock  Whos there  Romeo arise 
Thou wilt be taken  Stay awhile  Stand up 

Run to my study  By and by  Gods will 
What wilfulness is this  I come  I come 

Who knocks so hard  whence come you  whats your will 

Let me come in  and you shall know my errand 
I come from Lady Juliet 

Welcome  then 


O holy friar  O  tell me  holy friar 
Where is my ladys lord  wheres Romeo 

There on the ground  with his own tears made drunk 

O  he is even in my mistress case 
Just in her case 

O woeful sympathy 
Piteous predicament  Even so lies she 
Blubbering and weeping  weeping and blubbering 
Stand up  stand up  stand  an you be a man 
For Juliets sake  for her sake  rise and stand 
Why should you fall into so deep an O 

Nurse 

Ah  sir  ah  sir  Well  deaths the end of all 

Spakst thou of Juliet  how is it with her 
Doth she not think me an old murderer 
Now I have staind the childhood of our joy 
With blood removd but little from her own 
Where is she  and how doth she  and what says 
My conceald lady to our cancelld love 

O  she says nothing  sir  but weeps and weeps 
And now falls on her bed  and then starts up 
And Tybalt calls  and then on Romeo cries 
And then down falls again 

As if that name 
Shot from the deadly level of a gun 
Did murder her  as that names cursed hand 
Murderd her kinsman  O  tell me  friar  tell me 
In what vile part of this anatomy 
Doth my name lodge  tell me  that I may sack 
The hateful mansion 


Hold thy desperate hand 
Art thou a man  thy form cries out thou art 
Thy tears are womanish  thy wild acts denote 
The unreasonable fury of a beast 
Unseemly woman in a seeming man 
Or illbeseeming beast in seeming both 
Thou hast amazd me  by my holy order 
I thought thy disposition better temperd 
Hast thou slain Tybalt  wilt thou slay thyself 
And slay thy lady that in thy life lives 
By doing damned hate upon thyself 
Why railst thou on thy birth  the heaven  and earth 
Since birth  and heaven  and earth  all three do meet 
In thes at once  which thou at once wouldst lose 
Fie  fie  thou shamst thy shape  thy love  thy wit 
Which  like a usurer  aboundst in all 
And usest none in that true use indeed 
Which should bedeck thy shape  thy love  thy wit 
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax 
Digressing from the valour of a man 
Thy dear love  sworn  but hollow perjury 
Killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish 
Thy wit  that ornament to shape and love 
Misshapen in the conduct of them both 
Like powder in a skilless soldiers flask 
To set afire by thine own ignorance 
And thou dismemberd with thine own defence 
What  rouse thee  man  thy Juliet is alive 
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead 
There art thou happy  Tybalt would kill thee 
But thou slewst Tybalt  there art thou happy too 
The law that threatend death becomes thy friend 
And turns it to exile  there art thou happy 
A pack of blessings light upon thy back 
Happiness courts thee in her best array 
But  like a misbehavd and sullen wench 
Thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love 
Take heed  take heed  for such die miserable 
Go  get thee to thy love  as was decreed 
Ascend her chamber  hence and comfort her 
But look thou stay not till the watch be set 
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua 
Where thou shalt live  till we can find a time 
To blaze your marriage  reconcile your friends 
Beg pardon of the prince  and call thee back 
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy 
Than thou wentst forth in lamentation 
Go before  nurse  commend me to thy lady 
And bid her hasten all the house to bed 
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto 
Romeo is coming 

O Lord  I could have stayd here all the night 
To hear good counsel  O  what learning is 
My lord  Ill tell my lady you will come 

Do so  and bid my sweet prepare to chide 

Here  sir  a ring she bid me give you  sir 
Hie you  make haste  for it grows very late 


How well my comfort is revivd by this 

Go hence  goodnight  and here stands all your state 
Either be gone before the watch be set 
Or by the break of day disguisd from hence 
Sojourn in Mantua  Ill find out your man 
And he shall signify from time to time 
Every good hap to you that chances here 
Give me thy hand  tis late  farewell  goodnight 

But that a joy past joy calls out on me 
It were a grief so brief to part with thee 
Farewell 


Things have falln out  sir  so unluckily 
That we have had no time to move our daughter 
Look you  she lovd her kinsman Tybalt dearly 
And so did I  well  we were born to die 
Tis very late  shell not come down to night 
I promise you  but for your company 
I would have been abed an hour ago 

These times of woe afford no time to woo 
Madam  goodnight  commend me to your daughter 

I will  and know her mind early tomorrow 
Tonight shes mewd up to her heaviness 

Sir Paris  I will make a desperate tender 
Of my childs love  I think she will be ruld 
In all respects by me  nay  more  I doubt it not 
Wife go you to her ere you go to bed 
Acquaint her here of my son Paris love 
And bid her  mark you me  on Wednesday next 
But  soft  what day is this 

Monday  my lord 

Monday  ha  ha  Well  Wednesday is too soon 
O Thursday let it be  o Thursday  tell her 
She shall be married to this noble earl 
Will you be ready  do you like this haste 
Well keep no great ado  a friend or two 
For  hark you  Tybalt being slain so late 
It may be thought we held him carelessly 
Being our kinsman  if we revel much 
Therefore well have some half a dozen friends 
And there an end  But what say you to Thursday 

My lord  I would that Thursday were tomorrow 

Well  get you gone  o Thursday be it then 
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed 
Prepare her  wife  against this weddingday 
Farewell  my lord  Light to my chamber  ho 
Afore me  it is so very very late 
That we may call it early by and by 
Goodnight 


Wilt thou be gone  it is not yet near day 
It was the nightingale  and not the lark 
That piercd the fearful hollow of thine ear 
Nightly she sings on you pomegranate tree 
Believe me  love  it was the nightingale 

It was the lark  the herald of the morn 
No nightingale  look  love  what envious streaks 
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east 
Nights candles are burnt out  and jocund day 
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops 
I must be gone and live  or stay and die 

Yon light is not daylight  I know it  I 
It is some meteor that the sun exhales 
To be to thee this night a torchbearer 
And light thee on thy way to Mantua 
Therefore stay yet  thou needst not to be gone 

Let me be taen  let me be put to death 
I am content  so thou wilt have it so 
Ill say yon grey is not the mornings eye 
Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthias brow 
Nor that is not the lark  whose notes do beat 
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads 
I have more care to stay than will to go 
Come  death  and welcome  Juliet wills it so 
How ist  my soul  lets talk  it is not day 

It is  it is  hie hence  be gone  away 
It is the lark that sings so out of tune 
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps 
Some say the lark makes sweet division 
This doth not so  for she divideth us 
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes 
O  now I would they had changd voices too 
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray 
Hunting thee hence with huntsup to the day 
O  now be gone  more light and light it grows 

More light and light  more dark and dark our woes 


Madam 

Nurse 

Your lady mother is coming to your chamber 
The day is broke  be wary  look about 


Then  window  let day in  and let life out 

Farewell  farewell  one kiss  and Ill descend 


Art thou gone so  my lord  my love  my friend 
I must hear from thee every day in the hour 
For in a minute there are many days 
O  by this count I shall be much in years 
Ere I again behold my Romeo 

Farewell 
I will omit no opportunity 
That may convey my greetings  love  to thee 

O  thinkst thou we shall ever meet again 

I doubt it not  and all these woes shall serve 
For sweet discourses in our time to come 

O God  I have an illdivining soul 
Methinks I see thee  now thou art so low 
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb 
Either my eyesight fails  or thou lookst pale 

And trust me  love  in my eye so do you 
Dry sorrow drinks our blood  Adieu  adieu 


O fortune  fortune  all men call thee fickle 
If thou art fickle  what dost thou with him 
That is renownd for faith  Be fickle  fortune 
For then  I hope  thou wilt not keep him long 
But send him back 

Ho  daughter  are you up 

Who ist that calls  is it my lady mother 
Is she not down so late  or up so early 
What unaccustomd cause procures her hither 


Why  how now  Juliet 

Madam  I am not well 

Evermore weeping for your cousins death 
What  wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears 
And if thou couldst  thou couldst not make him live 
Therefore  have done  some grief shows much of love 
But much of grief shows still some want of wit 

Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss 

So shall you feel the loss  but not the friend 
Which you weep for 

Feeling so the loss 
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend 

Well  girl  thou weepst not so much for his death 
As that the villain lives which slaughterd him 

What villain  madam 

That same villain  Romeo 

Villain and he be many miles asunder 
God pardon him  I do  with all my heart 
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart 

That is because the traitor murderer lives 

Ay  madam  from the reach of these my hands 
Would none but I might venge my cousins death 

We will have vengeance for it  fear thou not 
Then weep no more  Ill send to one in Mantua 
Where that same banishd runsgate doth live 
Shall give him such an unaccustomd dram 
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company 
And then  I hope  thou wilt be satisfied 

Indeed  I never shall be satisfied 
With Romeo  till I behold him dead 
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vexd 
Madam  if you could find out but a man 
To bear a poison  I would temper it 
That Romeo should  upon receipt thereof 
Soon sleep in quiet  O  how my heart abhors 
To hear him namd  and cannot come to him 
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt 
Upon his body that hath slaughterd him 

Find thou the means  and Ill find such a man 
But now Ill tell thee joyful tidings  girl 

And joy comes well in such a needy time 
What are they  I beseech your ladyship 

Well  well  thou hast a careful father  child 
One who  to put thee from thy heaviness 
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy 
That thou expectst not  nor I lookd not for 

Madam  in happy time  what day is that 

Marry  my child  early next Thursday morn 
The gallant  young  and noble gentleman 
The County Paris  at Saint Peters church 
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride 

Now  by Saint Peters church  and Peter too 
He shall not make me there a joyful bride 
I wonder at this haste  that I must wed 
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo 
I pray you  tell my lord and father  madam 
I will not marry yet  and  when I do  I swear 
It shall be Romeo  whom you know I hate 
Rather than Paris  These are news indeed 

Here comes your father  tell him so yourself 
And see how he will take it at your hands 


When the sun sets  the air doth drizzle dew 
But for the sunset of my brothers son 
It rains downright 
How now  a conduit  girl  what  still in tears 
Evermore showering  In one little body 
Thou counterfeitst a bark  a sea  a wind 
For still thy eyes  which I may call the sea 
Do ebb and flow with tears  the bark thy body is 
Sailing in this salt flood  the winds  thy sighs 
Who  raging with thy tears  and they with them 
Without a sudden calm  will overset 
Thy tempesttossed body  How now  wife 
Have you deliverd to her our decree 

Ay  sir  but she will none  she gives you thanks 
I would the fool were married to her grave 

Soft  take me with you  take me with you  wife 
How  will she none  doth she not give us thanks 
Is she not proud  doth she not count her blessd 
Unworthy as she is  that we have wrought 
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom 

Not proud  you have  but thankful  that you have 
Proud can I never be of what I hate 
But thankful even for hate  that is meant love 

How now  how now  choplogic  What is this 
Proud  and I thank you  and I thank you not  
And yet not proud  mistress minion  you 
Thank me no thankings  nor proud me no prouds 
But fettle your fine joints gainst Thursday next 
To go with Paris to Saint Peters church 
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither 
Out  you greensickness carrion  out  you baggage 
You tallow face 

Fie  fie  what  are you mad 

Good father  I beseech you on my knees 
Hear me with patience but to speak a word 

Hang thee  young baggage  disobedient wretch 
I tell thee what  get thee to church o Thursday 
Or never after look me in the face 
Speak not  reply not  do not answer me 
My fingers itch Wife  we scarce thought us blessd 
That God had lent us but this only child 
But now I see this one is one too much 
And that we have a curse in having her 
Out on her  hilding 

God in heaven bless her 
You are to blame  my lord  to rate her so 

And why  my lady wisdom  hold your tongue 
Good prudence  smatter with your gossips  go 

I speak no treason 

O  God ye good den 

May not one speak 

Peace  you mumbling fool 
Utter your gravity oer a gossips bowl 
For here we need it not 

You are too hot 

Gods bread  it makes me mad 
Day  night  hour  tide  time  work  play 
Alone  in company  still my care hath been 
To have her matchd  and having now provided 
A gentleman of noble parentage 
Of fair demesnes  youthful  and nobly traind 
Stuffd  as they say  with honourable parts 
Proportiond as ones thought would wish a man 
And then to have a wretched puling fool 
A whining mammet  in her fortunes tender 
To answer Ill not wed  I cannot love  
I am too young  I pray you  pardon me  
But  an you will not wed  Ill pardon you 
Graze where you will  you shall not house with me 
Look tot  think ont  I do not use to jest 
Thursday is near  lay hand on heart  advise 
An you be mine  Ill give you to my friend 
An you be not  hang  beg  starve  die in the streets 
For  by my soul  Ill neer acknowledge thee 
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good 
Trust tot  bethink you  Ill not be forsworn 


Is there no pity sitting in the clouds 
That sees into the bottom of my grief 
O  sweet my mother  cast me not away 
Delay this marriage for a month  a week 
Or  if you do not  make the bridal bed 
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies 

Talk not to me  for Ill not speak a word 
Do as thou wilt  for I have done with thee 


O God  O nurse  how shall this be prevented 
My husband is on earth  my faith in heaven 
How shall that faith return again to earth 
Unless that husband send it me from heaven 
By leaving earth  comfort me  counsel me 
Alack  alack  that heaven should practise stratagems 
Upon so soft a subject as myself 
What sayst thou  hast thou not a word of joy 
Some comfort  nurse 

Faith  here it is  Romeo 
Is banished  and all the world to nothing 
That he dares neer come back to challenge you 
Or  if he do  it needs must be by stealth 
Then  since the case so stands as now it doth 
I think it best you married with the county 
O  hes a lovely gentleman 
Romeos a dishclout to him  an eagle  madam 
Hath not so green  so quick  so fair an eye 
As Paris hath  Beshrew my very heart 
I think you are happy in this second match 
For it excels your first  or if it did not 
Your first is dead  or twere as good he were 
As living here and you no use of him 

Speakest thou from thy heart 

And from my soul too 
Or else beshrew them both 

Amen 

What 

Well  thou hast comforted me marvellous much 
Go in  and tell my lady I am gone 
Having displeasd my father  to Laurence cell 
To make confession and to be absolvd 

Marry  I will  and this is wisely done 


Ancient damnation  O most wicked fiend 
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn 
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue 
Which she hath praisd him with above compare 
So many thousand times  Go  counsellor 
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain 
Ill to the friar  to know his remedy 
If all else fail  myself have power to die 


On Thursday  sir  the time is very short 

My father Capulet will have it so 
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste 

You say you do not know the ladys mind 
Uneven is the course  I like it not 

Immoderately she weeps for Tybalts death 
And therefore have I little talkd of love 
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears 
Now  sir  her father counts it dangerous 
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway 
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage 
To stop the inundation of her tears 
Which  too much minded by herself alone 
May be put from her by society 
Now do you know the reason of this haste 

I would I knew not why it should be slowd 
Look  sir  here comes the lady towards my cell 


Happily met  my lady and my wife 

That may be  sir  when I may be a wife 

That may be must be  love  on Thursday next 

What must be shall be 

Thats a certain text 

Come you to make confession to this father 

To answer that  I should confess to you 

Do not deny to him that you love me 

I will confess to you that I love him 

So will ye  I am sure  that you love me 

If I do so  it will be of more price 
Being spoke behind your back  than to your face 

Poor soul  thy face is much abusd with tears 

The tears have got small victory by that 
For it was bad enough before their spite 

Thou wrongst it  more than tears  with that report 

That is no slander  sir  which is a truth 
And what I spake  I spake it to my face 

Thy face is mine  and thou hast slanderd it 

It may be so  for it is not mine own 
Are you at leisure  holy father  now 
Or shall I come to you at evening mass 

My leisure serves me  pensive daughter  now 
My lord  we must entreat the time alone 

God shield  I should disturb devotion 
Juliet  on Thursday early will I rouse you 
Till then  adieu  and keep this holy kiss 


O  shut the door  and when thou hast done so 
Come weep with me  past hope  past cure  past help 

Ah  Juliet  I already know thy grief 
It strains me past the compass of my wits 
I hear thou must  and nothing may prorogue it 
On Thursday next be married to this county 

Tell me not  friar  that thou hearst of this 
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it 
If  in thy wisdom  thou canst give no help 
Do thou but call my resolution wise 
And with this knife Ill help it presently 
God joind my heart and Romeos  thou our hands 
And ere this hand  by thee to Romeo seald 
Shall be the label to another deed 
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt 
Turn to another  this shall slay them both 
Therefore  out of thy longexperiencd time 
Give me some present counsel  or behold 
Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife 
Shall play the umpire  arbitrating that 
Which the commission of thy years and art 
Could to no issue of true honour bring 
Be not so long to speak  I long to die 
If what thou speakst speak not of remedy 

Hold  daughter  I do spy a kind of hope 
Which craves as desperate an execution 
As that is desperate which we would prevent 
If  rather than to marry County Paris 
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself 
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake 
A thing like death to chide away this shame 
That copst with death himself to scape from it 
And  if thou darst  Ill give thee remedy 

O  bid me leap  rather than marry Paris 
From off the battlements of yonder tower 
Or walk in thievish ways  or bid me lurk 
Where serpents are  chain me with roaring bears 
Or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse 
Oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones 
With reeky shanks  and yellow chapless skulls 
Or bid me go into a newmade grave 
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud 
Things that  to hear them told  have made me tremble 
And I will do it without fear or doubt 
To live an unstaind wife to my sweet love 

Hold  then  go home  be merry  give consent 
To marry Paris  Wednesday is tomorrow 
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone 
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber 
Take thou this vial  being then in bed 
And this distilled liquor drink thou off 
When presently through all thy veins shall run 
A cold and drowsy humour  for no pulse 
Shall keep his native progress  but surcease 
No warmth  no breath  shall testify thou livst 
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade 
To paly ashes  thy eyes windows fall 
Like death  when he shuts up the day of life 
Each part  deprivd of supple government 
Shall  stiff and stark and cold  appear like death 
And in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death 
Thou shalt continue twoandforty hours 
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep 
Now  when the bridegroom in the morning comes 
To rouse thee from thy bed  there art thou dead 
Then as the manner of our country is 
In thy best robes uncoverd on the bier 
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault 
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie 
In the mean time  against thou shalt awake 
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift 
And hither shall he come  and he and I 
Will watch thy waking  and that very night 
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua 
And this shall free thee from this present shame 
If no unconstant toy  nor womanish fear 
Abate thy valour in the acting it 

Give me  give me  O  tell me not of fear 

Hold  get you gone  be strong and prosperous 
In this resolve  Ill send a friar with speed 
To Mantua  with my letters to thy lord 

Love  give me strength  and strength shall help afford 
Farewell  dear father 


So many guests invite as here are writ 

Sirrah  go hire me twenty cunning cooks 

You shall have none ill  sir  for 
Ill try if they can lick their fingers 

How canst thou try them so 

Marry  sir  tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers  therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me 

Go  be gone 

We shall be much unfurnishd for this time 
What  is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence 

Ay  forsooth 

Well  he may chance to do some good on her 
A peevish selfwilld harlotry it is 

See where she comes from shrift with merry look 


How now  my headstrong  where have you been gadding 

Where I have learnd me to repent the sin 
Of disobedient opposition 
To you and your behests  and am enjoind 
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here 
And beg your pardon  Pardon  I beseech you 
Henceforward I am ever ruld by you 

Send for the county  go tell him of this 
Ill have this knot knit up tomorrow morning 

I met the youthful lord at Laurence cell 
And gave him what becomed love I might 
Not stepping oer the bounds of modesty 

Why  Im glad ont  this is well  stand up 
This is ast should be  Let me see the county 
Ay  marry  go  I say  and fetch him hither 
Now  afore God  this reverend holy friar 
All our whole city is much bound to him 

Nurse  will you go with me into my closet 
To help me sort such needful ornaments 
As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow 

No  not till Thursday  there is time enough 

Go  nurse  go with her  Well to church tomorrow 


We shall be short in our provision 
Tis now near night 

Tush  I will stir about 
And all things shall be well  I warrant thee  wife 
Go thou to Juliet  help to deck up her 
Ill not to bed tonight  let me alone 
Ill play the housewife for this once  What  ho 
They are all forth  well  I will walk myself 
To County Paris  to prepare him up 
Against tomorrow  My heart is wondrous light 
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimd 


Ay  those attires are best  but  gentle nurse 
I pray thee  leave me to myself tonight 
For I have need of many orisons 
To move the heavens to smile upon my state 
Which  well thou knowst  is cross and full of sin 


What  are you busy  ho  need you my help 

No  madam  we have culld such necessaries 
As are behoveful for our state tomorrow 
So please you  let me now be left alone 
And let the nurse this night sit up with you 
For  I am sure  you have your hands full all 
In this so sudden business 

Goodnight 
Get thee to bed  and rest  for thou hast need 


Farewell  God knows when we shall meet again 
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins 
That almost freezes up the heat of life 
Ill call them back again to comfort me 
Nurse  What should she do here 
My dismal scene I needs must act alone 
Come  vial 
What if this mixture do not work at all 
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning 
No  no  this shall forbid it  lie thou there 

What if it be a poison  which the friar 
Subtly hath ministerd to have me dead 
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd 
Because he married me before to Romeo 
I fear it is  and yet  methinks  it should not 
For he hath still been tried a holy man 
I will not entertain so bad a thought 
How if  when I am laid into the tomb 
I wake before the time that Romeo 
Come to redeem me  theres a fearful point 
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault 
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in 
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes 
Or  if I live  is it not very like 
The horrible conceit of death and night 
Together with the terror of the place 
As in a vault  an ancient receptacle 
Where  for these many hundred years  the bones 
Of all my buried ancestors are packd 
Where bloody Tybalt  yet but green in earth 
Lies festering in his shroud  where  as they say 
At some hours in the night spirits resort 
Alack  alack  is it not like that I 
So early waking  what with loathsome smells 
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth 
That living mortals  hearing them  run mad 
O  if I wake  shall I not be distraught 
Environed with all these hideous fears 
And madly play with my forefathers joints 
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud 
And  in this rage  with some great kinsmans bone 
As with a club  dash out my desperate brains 
O  look  methinks I see my cousins ghost 
Seeking out Romeo  that did spit his body 
Upon a rapiers point  Stay  Tybalt  stay 
Romeo  I come  this do I drink to thee 


Hold  take these keys  and fetch more spices  nurse 

They call for dates and quinces in the pastry 


Come  stir  stir  stir  the second cock hath crowd 
The curfew bell hath rung  tis three oclock 
Look to the bakd meats  good Angelica 
Spare not for cost 

Go  go  you cotquean  go 
Get you to bed  faith  youll be sick tomorrow 
For this nights watching 

No  not a whit  what  I have watchd ere now 
All night for lesser cause  and neer been sick 

Ay  you have been a mousehunt in your time 
But I will watch you from such watching now 


A jealoushood  a jealoushood 


Now  fellow 

Whats there 

Things for the cook  sir  but I know not what 

Make haste  make haste 

Sirrah  fetch drier logs 
Call Peter  he will show thee where they are 

I have a head  sir  that will find out logs 
And never trouble Peter for the matter 


Mass  and well said  a merry whoreson  ha 
Thou shalt be loggerhead  Good faith  tis day 
The county will be here with music straight 
For so he said he would 

I hear him near 
Nurse  Wife  what  ho  What  nurse  I say 


Go waken Juliet  go and trim her up 
Ill go and chat with Paris  Hie  make haste 
Make haste  the bridegroom he is come already 
Make haste  I say 

Mistress  what  mistress  Juliet  fast  I warrant her  she 
Why  lamb  why  lady  fie  you slugabed 
Why  love  I say  madam  sweetheart  why  bride 
What  not a word  you take your pennyworths now 
Sleep for a week  for the next night  I warrant 
The County Paris hath set up his rest 
That you shall rest but little  God forgive me 
Marry  and amen  how sound is she asleep 
I needs must wake her  Madam  madam  madam 
Ay  let the county take you in your bed 
Hell fright you up  i faith  Will it not be 
What  dressd  and in your clothes  and down again 
I must needs wake you  Lady  lady  lady 
Alas  alas  Help  help  my ladys dead 
O  welladay  that ever I was born 
Some aquavit  ho  My lord  my lady 


What noise is here 

O lamentable day 

What is the matter 

Look  look  O heavy day 

O me  O me  my child  my only life 
Revive  look up  or I will die with thee 
Help  help  Call help 


For shame  bring Juliet forth  her lord is come 

Shes dead  deceasd  shes dead  alack the day 

Alack the day  shes dead  shes dead  shes dead 

Ha  let me see her  Out  alas  shes cold 
Her blood is settled  and her joints are stiff 
Life and these lips have long been separated 
Death lies on her like an untimely frost 
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field 

O lamentable day 

O woeful time 

Death  that hath taen her hence to make me wail 
Ties up my tongue  and will not let me speak 


Come  is the bride ready to go to church 

Ready to go  but never to return 
O son  the night before thy weddingday 
Hath Death lain with thy wife  There she lies 
Flower as she was  deflowered by him 
Death is my soninlaw  Death is my heir 
My daughter he hath wedded  I will die 
And leave him all  life  living  all is Deaths 

Have I thought long to see this mornings face 
And doth it give me such a sight as this 

Accursd  unhappy  wretched  hatefulday 
Most miserable hour  that eer time saw 
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage 
But one  poor one  one poor and loving child 
But one thing to rejoice and solace in 
And cruel death hath catchd it from my sight 

O woe  O woeful  woeful  woeful day 
Most lamentable day  most woeful day 
That ever  ever  I did yet behold 
O day  O day  O day  O hateful day 
Never was seen so black a day as this 
O woeful day  O woeful day 

Beguild  divorced  wronged  spited  slain 
Most detestable death  by thee beguild 
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown 
O love  O life  not life  but love in death 

Despisd  distressed  hated  martyrd  killd 
Uncomfortable time  why camst thou now 
To murder  murder our solemnity 
O child  O child  my soul  and not my child 
Dead art thou  dead  alack  my child is dead 
And with my child my joys are buried 

Peace  ho  for shame  confusions cure lives not 
In these confusions  Heaven and yourself 
Had part in this fair maid  now heaven hath all 
And all the better is it for the maid 
Your part in her you could not keep from death 
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life 
The most you sought was her promotion 
For twas your heaven she should be advancd 
And weep ye now  seeing she is advancd 
Above the clouds  as high as heaven itself 
O  in this love  you love your child so ill 
That you run mad  seeing that she is well 
Shes not well married that lives married long 
But shes best married that dies married young 
Dry up your tears  and stick your rosemary 
On this fair corse  and  as the custom is 
In all her best array bear her to church 
For though fond nature bids us all lament 
Yet natures tears are reasons merriment 

All things that we ordained festival 
Turn from their office to black funeral 
Our instruments to melancholy bells 
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast 
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change 
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse 
And all things change them to the contrary 

Sir  go you in  and  madam  go with him 
And go  Sir Paris  every one prepare 
To follow this fair corse unto her grave 
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill 
Move them no more by crossing their high will 


Faith  we may put up our pipes  and be gone 

Honest good fellows  ah  put up  put up  for  well you know  this is a pitiful case 


Ay  by my troth  the case may be amended 


Musicians  O  musicians  Hearts ease  Hearts ease  O  an ye will have me live  play Hearts ease  

Why Hearts ease  

O  musicians  because my heart itself plays My heart is full of woe  O  play me some merry dump  to comfort me 

Not a dump we  tis no time to play now 

You will not then 

No 

I will then give it you soundly 

What will you give us 

No money  on my faith  but the gleek 
I will give you the minstrel 

Then will I give you the servingcreature 

Then will I lay the servingcreatures dagger on your pate  I will carry no crotchets 
Ill re you  Ill fa you  Do you note me 

An you re us  and fa us  you note us 

Pray you  put up your dagger  and put out your wit 

Then have at you with my wit  I will drybeat you with an iron wit  and put up my iron dagger  Answer me like men 

When griping grief the heart doth wound 
And doleful dumps the mind oppress 
Then music with her silver sound 

Why silver sound  why music with her silver sound  What say you  Simon Catling 

Marry  sir  because silver hath a sweet sound 

Pretty  What say you  Hugh Rebeck 

I say silver sound  because musicians sound for silver 

Pretty too  What say you  James Soundpost 

Faith  I know not what to say 

O  I cry you mercy  you are the singer 
I will say for you  It is  music with her silver sound  because musicians have no gold for sounding 

Then music with her silver sound 
With speedy help doth lend redress 

What a pestilent knave is this same 

Hang him  Jack  Come  well in here  tarry for the mourners  and stay dinner 


If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep 
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand 
My bosoms lord sits lightly in his throne 
And all this day an unaccustomd spirit 
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts 
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead 
Strange dream  that gives a dead man leave to think 
And breathd such life with kisses in my lips 
That I revivd  and was an emperor 
Ah me  how sweet is love itself possessd 
When but loves shadows are so rich in joy 


News from Verona  How now  Balthasar 
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar 
How doth my lady  Is my father well 
How fares my Juliet  That I ask again 

For nothing can be ill if she be well 

Then she is well  and nothing can be ill 
Her body sleeps in Capels monument 
And her immortal part with angels lives 
I saw her laid low in her kindreds vault 
And presently took post to tell it you 
O  pardon me for bringing these ill news 
Since you did leave it for my office  sir 

Is it even so  then I defy you  stars 
Thou knowst my lodging  get me ink and paper 
And hire posthorses  I will hence tonight 

I do beseech you  sir  have patience 
Your looks are pale and wild  and do import 
Some misadventure 

Tush  thou art deceivd 
Leave me  and do the thing I bid thee do 
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar 

No  my good lord 

No matter  get thee gone 
And hire those horses  Ill be with thee straight 

Well  Juliet  I will he with thee tonight 
Lets see for means  O mischief  thou art swift 
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men 
I do remember an apothecary 
And hereabouts he dwells  which late I noted 
In tatterd weeds  with overwhelming brows 
Culling of simples  meagre were his looks 
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones 
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung 
An alligator stuffd  and other skins 
Of illshapd fishes  and about his shelves 
A beggarly account of empty boxes 
Green earthen pots  bladders  and musty seeds 
Remnants of packthread  and old cakes of roses 
Were thinly scatterd  to make up a show 
Noting this penury  to myself I said 
An if a man did need a poison now 
Whose sale is present death in Mantua 
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him 
O  this same thought did but forerun my need 
And this same needy man must sell it me 
As I remember  this should be the house 
Being holiday  the beggars shop is shut 
What  ho  apothecary 


Who calls so loud 

Come hither  man  I see that thou art poor 
Hold  there is forty ducats  let me have 
A dram of poison  such soonspeeding gear 
As will disperse itself through all the veins 
That the lifeweary taker may fall dead 
And that the trunk may be dischargd of breath 
As violently as hasty powder fird 
Doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb 

Such mortal drugs I have  but Mantuas law 
Is death to any he that utters them 

Art thou so bare  and full of wretchedness 
And fearst to die  famine is in thy cheeks 
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes 
Contempt and beggary hang upon thy back 
The world is not thy friend nor the worlds law 
The world affords no law to make thee rich 
Then be not poor  but break it  and take this 

My poverty  but not my will  consents 

I pay thy poverty  and not thy will 

Put this in any liquid thing you will 
And drink it off  and  if you had the strength 
Of twenty men  it would dispatch you straight 

There is thy gold  worse poison to mens souls 
Doing more murders in this loathsome world 
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell 
I sell thee poison  thou hast sold me none 
Farewell  buy food  and get thyself in flesh 
Come  cordial and not poison  go with me 
To Juliets grave  for there must I use thee 


Holy Franciscan friar  brother  ho 


This same should be the voice of Friar John 
Welcome from Mantua  what says Romeo 
Or  if his mind be writ  give me his letter 

Going to find a barefoot brother out 
One of our order  to associate me 
Here in this city visiting the sick 
And finding him  the searchers of the town 
Suspecting that we both were in a house 
Where the infectious pestilence did reign 
Seald up the doors  and would not let us forth 
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayd 

Who bare my letter then to Romeo 

I could not send it  here it is again 
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee 
So fearful were they of infection 

Unhappy fortune  by my brotherhood 
The letter was not nice  but full of charge 
Of dear import  and the neglecting it 
May do much danger  Friar John  go hence 
Get me an iron crow  and bring it straight 
Unto my cell 

Brother  Ill go and bring it thee 


Now must I to the monument alone 
Within these three hours will fair Juliet wake 
She will beshrew me much that Romeo 
Hath had no notice of these accidents 
But I will write again to Mantus 
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come 
Poor living corse  closd in a dead mans tomb 


Give me thy torch  boy  hence  and stand aloof 
Yet put it out  for I would not be seen 
Under yond yewtrees lay thee all along 
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground 
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread 
Being loose  unfirm with digging up of graves 
But thou shalt hear it  whistle then to me 
As signal that thou hearst something approach 
Give me those flowers  Do as I bid thee  go 

I am almost afraid to stand alone 
Here in the churchyard  yet I will adventure 


Sweet flower  with flowers thy bridal bed I strew 
O woe  thy canopy is dust and stones 
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew 
Or  wanting that  with tears distilld by moans 
The obsequies that I for thee will keep 
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep 

The boy gives warning something doth approach 
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight 
To cross my obsequies and true loves rite 
What  with a torch muffle me  night  awhile 

Give me that mattock  and the wrenching iron 
Hold  take this letter  early in the morning 
See thou deliver it to my lord and father 
Give me the light  upon thy life I charge thee 
Whateer thou hearst or seest  stand all aloof 
And do not interrupt me in my course 
Why I descend into this bed of death 
Is partly  to behold my ladys face 
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger 
A precious ring  a ring that I must use 
In dear employment  therefore hence  be gone 
But  if thou  jealous  dost return to pry 
In what I further shall intend to do 
By heaven  I will tear thee joint by joint 
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs 
The time and my intents are savagewild 
More fierce and more inexorable far 
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea 

I will be gone  sir  and not trouble you 

So shalt thou show me friendship  Take thou that 
Live  and be prosperous  and farewell  good fellow 

For all this same  Ill hide me here about 
His looks I fear  and his intents I doubt 


Thou detestable maw  thou womb of death 
Gorgd with the dearest morsel of the earth 
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open 

And  in despite  Ill cram thee with more food 

This is that banishd haughty Montague 
That murderd my loves cousin  with which grief 
It is supposed the fair creature died 
And here is come to do some villanous shame 
To the dead bodies  I will apprehend him 

Stop thy unhallowd toil  vile Montague 
Can vengeance be pursud further than death 
Condemned villain  I do apprehend thee 
Obey  and go with me  for thou must die 

I must  indeed  and therefore came I hither 
Good gentle youth  tempt not a desperate man 
Fly hence and leave me  think upon these gone 
Let them affright thee  I beseech thee  youth 
Put not another sin upon my head 
By urging me to fury  O  be gone 
By heaven  I love thee better than myself 
For I come hither armd against myself 
Stay not  be gone  live  and hereafter say 
A madmans mercy bade thee run away 

I do defy thy conjurations 
And apprehend thee for a felon here 

Wilt thou provoke me  then have at thee  boy 


O Lord  they fight  I will go call the watch 


O  I am slain If thou be merciful 
Open the tomb  lay me with Juliet 


In faith  I will  Let me peruse this face 
Mercutios kinsman  noble County Paris 
What said my man when my betossed soul 
Did not attend him as we rode  I think 
He told me Paris should have married Juliet 
Said he not so  or did I dream it so 
Or am I mad  hearing him talk of Juliet 
To think it was so  O  give me thy hand 
One writ with me in sour misfortunes book 
Ill bury thee in a triumphant grave 
A grave  O  no  a lanthorn  slaughterd youth 
For here lies Juliet  and her beauty makes 
This vault a feasting presence full of light 
Death  lie thou there  by a dead man interrd 

How oft when men are at the point of death 
Have they been merry  which their keepers call 
A lightning before death  O  how may I 
Call this a lightning  O my love  my wife 
Death  that hath suckd the honey of thy breath 
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty 
Thou art not conquerd  beautys ensign yet 
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks 
And deaths pale flag is not advanced there 
Tybalt  liest thou there in thy bloody sheet 
O  what more favour can I do to thee 
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain 
To sunder his that was thine enemy 
Forgive me  cousin  Ah  dear Juliet 
Why art thou yet so fair  Shall I believe 
That unsubstantial Death is amorous 
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps 
Thee here in dark to be his paramour 
For fear of that I still will stay with thee 
And never from this palace of dim night 
Depart again  here  here will I remain 
With worms that are thy chambermaids  O  here 
Will I set up my everlasting rest 
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars 
From this worldwearied flesh  Eyes  look your last 
Arms  take your last embrace  and  lips  O you 
The doors of breath  seal with a righteous kiss 
A dateless bargain to engrossing death 
Come  bitter conduct  come  unsavoury guide 
Thou desperate pilot  now at once run on 
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark 
Heres to my love 

O true apothecary 
Thy drugs are quick  Thus with a kiss I die 

Saint Francis be my speed  how oft tonight 
Have my old feet stumbled at graves  Whos there 

Heres one  a friend  and one that knows you well 

Bliss be upon you  Tell me  good my friend 
What torch is yond  that vainly lends his light 
To grubs and eyeless skulls  as I discern 
It burneth in the Capels monument 

It doth so  holy sir  and theres my master 
One that you love 

Who is it 

Romeo 

How long hath he been there 

Full half an hour 

Go with me to the vault 

I dare not  sir 
My master knows not but I am gone hence 
And fearfully did menace me with death 
If I did stay to look on his intents 

Stay then  Ill go alone  Fear comes upon me 
O  much I fear some ill unlucky thing 

As I did sleep under this yewtree here 
I dreamt my master and another fought 
And that my master slew him 

Romeo 
Alack  alack  what blood is this which stains 
The stony entrance of this sepulchre 
What mean these masterless and gory swords 
To lie discolourd by this place of peace 

Romeo  O  pale  Who else  what  Paris too 
And steepd in blood  Ah  what an unkind hour 
Is guilty of this lamentable chance 
The lady stirs 


O  comfortable friar  where is my lord 
I do remember well where I should be 
And there I am  Where is my Romeo 


I hear some noise  Lady  come from that nest 
Of death  contagion  and unnatural sleep 
A greater power than we can contradict 
Hath thwarted our intents  come  come away 
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead 
And Paris too  come  Ill dispose of thee 
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns 
Stay not to question  for the watch is coming 
Come  go  good Juliet 

I dare no longer stay 

Go  get thee hence  for I will not away 

Whats here  a cup  closd in my true loves hand 
Poison  I see  hath been his timeless end 
O churl  drunk all  and left no friendly drop 
To help me after  I will kiss thy lips 
Haply  some poison yet doth hang on them 
To make me die with a restorative 

Thy lips are warm 

Lead  boy  which way 

Yea  noise  then Ill be brief  O happy dagger 

This is thy sheath 

there rest  and let me die 

This is the place  there where the torch doth burn 

The ground is bloody  search about the churchyard 
Go  some of you  whoeer you find  attach 

Pitiful sight  here lies the county slain 
And Juliet bleeding  warm  and newly dead 
Who here hath lain these two days buried 
Go  tell the prince  run to the Capulets 
Raise up the Montagues  some others search 

We see the ground whereon these woes do lie 
But the true ground of all these piteous woes 
We cannot without circumstance descry 


Heres Romeos man  we found him in the churchyard 

Hold him in safety  till the prince come hither 


Here is a friar  that trembles  sighs  and weeps 
We took this mattock and this spade from him 
As he was coming from this churchyard side 

A great suspicion  stay the friar too 


What misadventure is so early up 
That calls our person from our mornings rest 


What should it be  that they so shriek abroad 

The people in the street cry Romeo 
Some Juliet  and some Paris  and all run 
With open outcry toward our monument 

What fear is this which startles in our ears 

Sovereign  here lies the County Paris slain 
And Romeo dead  and Juliet  dead before 
Warm and new killd 

Search  seek  and know how this foul murder comes 

Here is a friar  and slaughterd Romeos man 
With instruments upon them  fit to open 
These dead mens tombs 

O  heaven O wife  look how our daughter bleeds 
This dagger hath mistaen for  lo  his house 
Is empty on the back of Montague 
And is missheathed in my daughters bosom 

O me  this sight of death is as a bell 
That warns my old age to a sepulchre 


Come  Montague  for thou art early up 
To see thy son and heir more early down 

Alas  my liege  my wife is dead tonight 
Grief of my sons exile hath stoppd her breath 
What further woe conspires against mine age 

Look  and thou shalt see 

O thou untaught  what manners is in this 
To press before thy father to a grave 

Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while 
Till we can clear these ambiguities 
And know their spring  their head  their true descent 
And then will I be general of your woes 
And lead you even to death  meantime forbear 
And let mischance be slave to patience 
Bring forth the parties of suspicion 

I am the greatest  able to do least 
Yet most suspected  as the time and place 
Doth make against me  of this direful murder 
And here I stand  both to impeach and purge 
Myself condemned and myself excusd 

Then say at once what thou dost know in this 

I will be brief  for my short date of breath 
Is not so long as is a tedious tale 
Romeo  there dead  was husband to that Juliet 
And she  there dead  that Romeos faithful wife 
I married them  and their stolen marriageday 
Was Tybalts doomsday  whose untimely death 
Banishd the newmade bridegroom from this city 
For whom  and not for Tybalt  Juliet pind 
You  to remove that siege of grief from her 
Betrothd  and would have married her perforce 
To County Paris  then comes she to me 
And  with wild looks bid me devise some mean 
To rid her from this second marriage 
Or in my cell there would she kill herself 
Then gave I her so tutord by my art 
A sleeping potion  which so took effect 
As I intended  for it wrought on her 
The form of death  meantime I writ to Romeo 
That he should hither come as this dire night 
To help to take her from her borrowd grave 
Being the time the potions force should cease 
But he which bore my letter  Friar John 
Was stayd by accident  and yesternight 
Returnd my letter back  Then  all alone 
At the prefixed hour of her waking 
Came I to take her from her kindreds vault 
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell 
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo 
But  when I came some minute ere the time 
Of her awakening here untimely lay 
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead 
She wakes  and I entreated her come forth 
And bear this work of heaven with patience 
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb 
And she  too desperate  would not go with me 
But  as it seems  did violence on herself 
All this I know  and to the marriage 
Her nurse is privy  and  if aught in this 
Miscarried by my fault  let my old life 
Be sacrificd  some hour before his time 
Unto the rigour of severest law 

We still have known thee for a holy man 
Wheres Romeos man  what can he say in this 

I brought my master news of Juliets death 
And then in post he came from Mantua 
To this same place  to this same monument 
This letter he early bid me give his father 
And threatend me with death  going in the vault 
If I departed not and left him there 

Give me the letter  I will look on it 
Where is the countys page that raisd the watch 
Sirrah  what made your master in this place 

He came with flowers to strew his ladys grave 
And bid me stand aloof  and so I did 
Anon  comes one with light to ope the tomb 
And by and by my master drew on him 
And then I ran away to call the watch 

This letter doth make good the friars words 
Their course of love  the tidings of her death 
And here he writes that he did buy a poison 
Of a poor pothecary  and therewithal 
Came to this vault to die  and lie with Juliet 
Where be these enemies Capulet  Montague 
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate 
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love 
And I  for winking at your discords too 
Have lost a brace of kinsmen  all are punishd 

O brother Montague  give me thy hand 
This is my daughters jointure  for no more 
Can I demand 

But I can give thee more 
For I will raise her statue in pure gold 
That while Verona by that name is known 
There shall no figure at such rate be set 
As that of true and faithful Juliet 

As rich shall Romeo by his lady lie 
Poor sacrifices of our enmity 

A glooming peace this morning with it brings 
The sun  for sorrow  will not show his head 
Go hence  to have more talk of these sad things 
Some shall be pardond  and some punished 
For never was a story of more woe 
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo
