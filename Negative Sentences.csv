hubeis capital city is wuhan ground zero of the new coronavirus

cash flow was also very strong at more than us$1 billion in the fourth quarter morgan stanleys adam jonas wrote in a note to clients
theres really nothing here for the bears to highlight added the analyst who cut his rating on the stock to underperform just two weeks ago
jonas is among 18 analysts surveyed that have a sellequivalent rating on tesla twice the amount that rate the shares a buy
while short interest has declined as the stock rallied in recent months it remains at about 11 per cent of the free float according to ihs markit data
tesla has been on a dizzying rally so far this year adding 39 per cent in value through wednesday and sending analysts scrambling to boost their price targets
even still shares took off after the earnings beat with impressive speed jumping nearly us$80 apiece in less than an hour
heres what else analysts had to say
wedbush dan ives
neutral price target us$550
we would characterize the fundamental performance as impressive with clear momentum looking ahead as a global inflection in electric vehicle demand appears on the horizon
hitting the important 500000 delivery threshold for fullyear 2020 is well within reach as now based on wedbushs chinese demand scenario analysis
rbc joseph spak
underperform price target raised to us$530 from us$315
admits to being misguided in some assumptions and thus significantly raises his estimates postresults
however on a reasonable base case still believes tesla is overvalued
notes that despite the slight revenue increase total gross profit and automotive gross profit declined yearonyear
but if bulls keep dreaming the dream theres room to run to rbcs $928 a share upside case
jefferies philippe houchois
buy price target us$600
quarterly earnings were as expected but free cash flow was twotimes consensus
notes chief executive officer elon musk dismissed raising capital as unnecessary arguing tesla is not in any way holding back investment
however lack of capital expenditure guidance is disappointing while the unfolding coronavirus creates some uncertainty with a 12 week mandated shutdown in shanghai
in fact see some negatives regarding nearterm full selfdriving capabilities
magnitude of the beat and underlying metrics was underwhelming while 2020 delivery guidance could be viewed as light versus the guidance given at first quarter 2019
cautious on chasing the stock amid a number of flaws in the bull case regarding north american demand and teslas automated vehicles positioning
canaccord genuity jed dorsheimer
buy price target us$750 from us$515
essentially flat gross margins compared to the prior quarter were a meaningful feat given the ramp associated with gigafactory shanghai moving to begin production resulting in an operating margin of 49 per cent and we expect to see that number improve as deliveries of chinese model 3s begin
given the numerous positive data points that were discussed and the cornerstone of continued profitability and free cash flow generation we view the company as solidly positioned as the leader of the electric vehicle revolution

source wires the outbreak of coronavirus is quickly unraveling gains made by global markets from the uschina trade deal euphoria with major indices trading 29 per cent lower than their midjanuary peaks
the global market capitalisation has seen an erosion of $22 trillion in the last week of january
foreign brokerages are bracing for a larger impact on the global markets than what was during the sars outbreak which also originated in china back in 2003
we expect a bigger and possibly longer macro impact on asia than what was seen during sars
our base case is that 12 months from now the asian economy will be near where it would have been without the wuhan virus but we see a sizeable risk of a significantly worse outcome credit suisse said in a note
coronavirus has also been termed as the wuhan virus as it is believed to have originated from the animal and seafood market of the chinese city
before the outbreak became known global markets had seen a sharp spurt after the first phase of the uschina trade deal was announced in middecember
brokerages fear possibility of a more protracted outbreak
sars was basically a onequarter event as far as consumer and travel panic is concerned but the wuhan virus might hurt sentiment for a longer period
so far asian indices have been worst hit
hang seng is down nine per cent from its midjanuary peak giving up most of the gains 115 per cent it made on the back of the uschina trade deal
among other asian indices taiwan taiex is down 62 per cent from this years peak south koreas kospi is down 526 per cent and chinas shanghai composite is down 446 per cent
domestic indices  nifty and sensex  are down 26 per cent and 25 per cent respectively

the novel coronavirus has now infected almost 10000 people around the world
the spike in the number of new cases prompted the world health organization to declare the outbreak a global health emergency on thursday
the main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in china but what is happening in other countries said who chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus
the concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems
the death toll now stands at 170 people in china
most cases have emerged in people who have travelled from the chinese city of wuhan where the outbreak began
however there have been eight cases of humantohuman infection  in germany japan vietnam and the united states
dr tedros speaking at the press conference in geneva described the virus as an unprecedented outbreak that has been met with an unprecedented response
let me be clear this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in china he added
bbc health correspondent james gallagher said the who will now be able to support lower and middle income countries helping them strengthen their disease surveillance and prepare them for possible cases
how unusual is this declaration?
it has previously declared five global public health emergencies swine flu 2009  the h1n1 virus spread across the world in 2009 killing more than 200000 people and a public health emergency was called to ensure the world was carefully monitoring its spread and able to respond including with vaccines

zika 2016  the who declared zika a public health emergency in 2016 after the disease spread rapidly through the americas
although for many zika symptoms are mild it can be dangerous for pregnant women and the emergency was called to spur urgent research
ebola 2014 and 2019  the deadly disease has twice been declared a public health emergency
the first one lasted from august 2014 to march 2016 as almost 30000 people were infected and more than 11000 died in west africa
the who cited the virulence of the virus the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns and the weak health systems in affected countries
a second emergency was declared last year as an outbreak spread in dr congo
how is china handling the outbreak?
although questions have been raised about transparency the who has praised chinas handling of the outbreak
president xi jinping has vowed to defeat what he called a devil virus
the central province of hubei where nearly all deaths have occurred is in a state of lockdown
the city has effectively been sealed off and china has put numerous transport restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus
people who have been in hubei are also being told by their employers to work from home until it is considered safe for them to return
several international airlines have stopped or scaled back their routes to china and companies like google ikea starbucks and tesla have closed their shops or stopped operations
reuters file photo of german share price index dax graph at the stock exchange in frankfurt germany the coronavirus scare has wiped $12 trillion from global stock markets in the last two weeks as new cases of the deadly virus multiplied stoking fears of an economic slowdown spreading from its chinese epicenter to the rest of the world
the goldman sachs china exposure basket of european stocks has slumped 5 per cent this week alone
elsewhere electrolux shares dropped on friday after the group warned the outbreak would hit its sourcing of products and components from china
major names in travel luxury and retail globally have also been hit as hundreds of millions of people who were preparing to travel for the chinese holidays canceled their plans
yet the virus  which chinese president xi jinping has described as a devil  has had a bigger impact on european companies than their us peers due to their high exposure to china
analysts have drawn comparisons with the deadly sars outbreak in 20022003 but the readacross is limited as chinas share of global gross domestic product has quadrupled since then to 16 per cent

at the staycity hotel on friday business carried on as usual with guests continuing to check in for weekend breaks in york despite the firm confirming that two people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the uk had been staying there
outside the hotel two guests told the guardian that as recently as friday morning they had been told by reception staff the reports that two tourists had been taken ill from their apartment on wednesday were lies
this morning they said it was a lie and not to listen to it said andy neale 21 who is staying at staycity for the night with his girlfriend
they shouldve taken some precaution
he added that the incident had marred the couples getaway saying my girlfriend is stressing out shes using hand wipes on everything
a family who were staying in the hotel on a visit from asia to see their daughter who is a student in york said they had been told the cases were false information when they asked staff if reports were true
helen papakosta 15 from greece showed reporters a video she had taken on her phone of people in hazmat suits arriving at the hotel on thursday morning  presumably to deep clean the suite where the affected guests had been staying
although her mother chrisa papakosta 48 whom she had been staying at the hotel with was unfazed by the event she was concerned by it
we have been advised by public health england that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff and as such our york property remains open for business
in due course the apartment concerned will undergo a thorough environmental clean and disinfection by a specialist contractor
we would like to reassure all our guests that we are following official advice on this matter and that the health and safety of everyone working and staying in our properties remains of paramount importance to us

the two cases were staying in york when they became unwell
close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases

the wuhan coronavirus outbreak is a new illness and scientists are still assessing how it spreads from person to person but similar viruses tend to spread via cough and sneeze droplets 
when an infected person coughs or sneezes they release droplets of saliva or mucus
these droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands then transferred when someone touches their face causing infection
for flu some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer

i was sick last week
it was nothing serious  just a nagging cough and cloggedup head
and it was over before it really began aggressive doses of extrastrength medicine knocked it out of me after a couple of nights
i was nothing more than one of the thousands of canadians who at any given time are battling a little sniffle or scratchy throat
except i wasnt
last weekend brought the announcement of the first case of a novel coronavirus 2019ncov in ontario where a 17yearold epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars remains only lightly buried in the graveyard of our collective memory
and early cases have been linked to the city of wuhan where about a third of the worlds cases are located in central china  a country that is increasingly being inescapably writ onto the skin of the two million chinesecanadians like me
the memory that affirmed that reality for me is lightly buried too
in 2003 i  an eighthgrade nerd just looking to commute from the suburb of richmond hill ont where nearly onethird of residents now identify as chinese to my downtown toronto high school  was among the chinesecanadians who were treated like an alien because of sars fears
i remember the weight of the textbookladen backpack i was trucking that morning
and i remember that id barely settled into it when the person next to me bolted up put a mask on his face and backed away
i remember how he stared at me with disgust
that is to say he saw me as chinese by both of the words definitions
i was ethnically chinese  han to be precise as 92 per cent of chinas population is
in that moment and in all the others before and since i was trying to just be what i was and am a chinesecanadian
but that was the first time in which someone had denied me that second part of that identity
to that man there was a hard dividing line in the hyphen between chinese and canadian as if canadian was an ethnicity
i couldnt really be the second because of the fluctuating freight of the first
for centuries chinesecanadians have faced ethnic stereotyping
but when sars struck i couldnt escape the brandnew clichs that were being inaccurately projected onto the visible colour of my skin broad ideas and sometimesthin opinions about china the country
so this past week even as others coughed and sniffled around me on buses and subways i stifled any hint of my slight sickness
i know i wasnt alone

carlos osorio/reuters
just as was the case when sars struck some canadians seem to be steering clear of people who appear ethnically chinese
tonny louie the chair of the toronto chinatown business improvement area told the globe and mail he noticed a downturn this week invoking memories of empty dim sum restaurants and plummeting sales in places like pacific mall north americas largest chinese indoor shopping centre
stories from chinesecanadians about being avoided in public spaces have flashed through social media amid some clamour for panicked overbroad quarantines echoing an ipsos poll early into the 2003 epidemic that found that twothirds of canadians wanted individuals arriving from sarsaffected areas to lose their freedom of movement or not be allowed into the country
and with preposterous conspiracies flying  including baseless ethnonationalist accusations that the coronavirus was developed as a bioweapon by the chinese state or was stolen by chinese scientists from a winnipeg lab  a woman eating bat soup has quickly become the defining image with which some ignorant online hecklers have responded to the outbreak
thats despite the fact that the woman in question a blogger from china ate the bat three years ago; the fact that bat soup is not a widespread delicacy in china but more so in places like palau where the video was shot; the fact that there is not yet a direct scientific link between the coronavirus and bats specifically but rather more broadly to the exotic wildlife sold illegally in a wuhan seafood market; the fact that polling suggests chinese citizens are keenly aware of the national problem of foodsafety standards; and the fact that chinese cuisine hardly owns the monopoly on unusual foods  as if the west does not savour say the livers of forcefattened geese
these reversions to our basest racial clichs  that being chinese is the same as being unclean  did not happen by accident
and as a result the line that halves the definition of the term chinesecanadian threatens to become even thicker  erasing the identities and histories of those who regardless of their individual opinions on the matter have nothing to do with the peoples republic of china or the chinese communist party ccp
chinesecanadians are chinese yes but we are canadian
the distinction needs to be made
its were ascribing to you the chinese all the things we dont like about china too
and if this is left unaddressed  as has largely happened over the course of two centuries  broad sinophobia can fester potentially setting the foundation for irrational fear to turn into discrimination and for that to harden into social fact
at this time chinese immigration to canada was effectively banned
previously from 1885 to 1923 newcomers from china were charged a head tax of $50 to $500 per person
both policies were explicitly racist designed to favour white immigrants over asian ones
chinese restaurants reported a drop in business that they attributed to panic over the disease
fred lum/the globe and mail
open this photo in gallery toronto 2006 chinesecanadians hold signs and speak to the media at union station as several set off for ottawa where prime minister stephen harper formally apologized for the chinese head tax
the red line was thick when canadas federal government banned ethnic chinese migrants regardless of nationality for more than two decades or when it imposed a head tax to discourage their arrival or when chinese immigrants were ghettoized in cheaper dangerous shanty communities later glorified as chinatowns
from the 19th century and into the 20th the bright red line made the idea that we could be canadian impossible
we were merely and to many despicably chinese prevented from joining up with the nationality we sought; even after we became citizens by law we were denied the franchise as recently as 1947 the yellow peril  the idea that we represent an existential threat to white labourers and societies because of some kind of inherent work ethic or that we are dirty dealers in iniquity and therefore unworthy of the west  was a fear that even in its name chained itself to the colour they used to describe our skin
chinese families represent the largest ethnic group of asian canadians who in turn comprise more than a fifth of canadas population
we are olympic medallists members of parliament and veterans and like any diaspora here we have worked to weave our way into the knotty national fabric
but increasingly chinesecanadians ethnicity is becoming bound up with the actions of a state that is being seen as a threat to the western world
a looming decision on whether ottawa will allow major chinese telecomequipment maker huawei to build part of canadas 5g wirelessnetwork infrastructure has cast a spotlight on the rising perception that chinese investment is nefarious
jane wolsak/reuters
then add in the case of meng wanzhou the huawei executive who faces extradition to the us on criminal charges after her arrest in vancouver
beijings response has only made things worse
these cruel actions are the chinese states to bear but it can be easier to confuse ethnicity and nationality every day the highprofile case absorbs frontpage headlines
this isnt all that surprising since the chinese communist party has a habit of complicating things for and hooking itself to the whole cloth of the chinesecanadian diaspora whether we like it or not
last august the ccps central committee publicly urged people of chinese background in nations like canada  what beijing calls overseas chinese  to remember the call from the party and the people and spread chinas voice
even though some experts and a parliamentary panel have stated that the diaspora has proven largely immune to pressure the suspicions being engendered certainly make it harder to distinguish between the ethnicity and nationality of chinesecanadians
darryl dyck/the canadian press
to some degree suspicion of foreigners is a natural consequence of nationalsecurity apparatuses identifying states as threats
not because tomorrow there will be violence but that as with antisemitism this could grow under the radar
but while politicians and security organizations must tread carefully thats not where the real work will have to be done
but they cant control how canadians think
multiple reports have laid the blame for the citys unaffordable housing market on foreign ownership mostly from china
in the 14 months after the foreignbuyers tax came into force the percentage of home purchasers in metro vancouver who werent canadian citizens permanent residents or who didnt have work permits plunged from 148 per cent to an average of 323 per cent ; affordability remains an issue
and so when there are headlines like vancouvers hot housing market just got tougher for wealthy chinese or  vancouver has been transformed by chinese immigrants its little wonder that the word chinese has begun to lose all sense of meaning
and it has neatly folded into the existing archetypes people can reach for in times of panic  much as the image of bat soup has

who made the announcement thursday setting in motion the global cooperation needed to combat the public health emergency of international concern
it is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country who warned
thus all countries should be prepared for containment it said including active surveillance early detection isolation and case management contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019ncov infection and to share full data with who
this declaration comes as the coronavirus outbreak which now bears the official interim name of 2019ncov acute respiratory disease continues to infect thousands more every day in the epicenter of china
the virus has been reported to be able to kill people without even giving them a fever  a symptom many checkpoints rely on to identify the infected
there is speculation that the virus is so contagious that it can even enter through the unprotected eye 
in its declaration of emergency who revealed the latest data from the chinese government which paint a grim picture
remember just last week china reported only a few hundred infected 
this number has increased more than tenfold to nearly 20000 despite the countrys massive quarantine
there are now 7711 confirmed and 12167 suspected cases throughout [china] the who news release states
of the confirmed cases 1370 are severe and 170 people have died
124 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital
its uncertain how much of this is due to humantohuman transmission an increasingly worrying problem with the outbreak
this method of transmission was discovered in the united states the same day who made its emergency announcement
previously all confirmed us cases had been associated with travel to wuhan china where an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by this novel coronavirus has been ongoing since december 2019 a us centers for disease control and prevention news release said
geneva ap  the world health organization declared the outbreak sparked by a new virus in china that has spread to more than a dozen countries as a global emergency thursday after the number of cases spiked more than tenfold in a week
china first informed who about cases of the new virus in late december
experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in china and have noted with concern instances in other countries  including the united states france japan germany canada south korea and vietnam  where there have also been isolated cases of humantohuman transmission
the main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in china but because of what is happening in other countries he said
this declaration is not a vote of nonconfidence in china he said
on the contrary who continues to have the confidence in chinas capacity to control the outbreak
the announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries
there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade he said
he added that chinese president xi jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders
on thursday france confirmed that a doctor who was in contact with a patient with the new virus later became infected himself
the doctor is now being treated in an isolated room at a paris hospital
outbreak specialists worry that the spread of new viruses from patients to health workers can signal the virus is becoming adapted to human transmission
it had been de facto closed because of the lunar new year holiday but russian authorities said the closure would be extended until march 1
meanwhile the united states and south korea confirmed their first cases of persontoperson spread of the virus
the man in the us is married to a 60yearold chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to wuhan the chinese city that is the epicenter of the outbreak
the case in south korea was a 56yearold man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier
although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with close contact like within families the instances of spread to people who may have had less exposure to the virus in japan and germany is worrying
the woman had shown no symptoms of the virus until her flight back to china
thats the kind of transmission chain that we dont want to see said marion koopmans an infectious diseases specialist at erasmus university medical center in the netherlands and a member of whos emergency committee
koopmans said more information was needed about how the virus was spread in these instances and whether it meant the virus was more infectious than previously thought or if there was something unusual in those circumstances
if transmission between humans was difficult then the numbers would have plateaued he said
harris said the limited amount of virus spread beyond china suggested the outbreak could still be contained but that if people are spreading the disease before they show symptoms  as some chinese politicians and researchers have suggested  that could compromise control efforts
the new virus has now infected more people in china than were sickened there during the 20022003 outbreak of sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome a cousin of the new virus
both are from the coronavirus family which also includes those that can cause the common cold
of the new deaths 37 were in hubei province of which wuhan is the capital and one was in the southwestern province of sichuan
china extended its lunar new year holiday to sunday to try to keep people home but the wave of returning travelers could potentially cause the virus to spread further
that stands in stark contrast to the initial response to sars when medical reports were hidden as state secrets
the delayed response was blamed for allowing the disease to spread worldwide killing around 800 people
dr jeremy farrar director of britains wellcome trust welcomed whos emergency declaration
it is also a stark reminder of how vulnerable we are to epidemics of infectious diseases known and unknown
a performance by the shanghai chinese orchestra went on as planned in muscatine on thursday night
the reported outbreak of coronavirus was in wuhan china  thats over 500 miles away from shanghai; a similar distance from the quad cities to nashville
a performance by the shanghai chinese orchestra went on as planned in muscatine on thursday night
you cant get this anywhere
it can be $1570 for a ticket anywhere else said janet clark who is on the muscatinechina initiatives committee and sat in on the performance
in muscatine though the concert was free
clark explained she loves the idea of having chinese performers come into the rural area of iowa it just broadens your world
i came out here today because i wanted to see a show and just why not shared william venzon who went to the show with his mom and siblings
muscatine high schools principal made a statement earlier in the week saying theres no reason to be concerned
and coordinator xiaowen guo assures us there is no risk as they arrive in the country they came through numerous screenings already
they arrived in los angeles they have very stringent screenings and have performed in numerous cities already
a few performers even arrived before the outbreak
so those in attendance arent worried i was not worried about it we had done some research and looked into it said erin mckee who took her kids to see the show
william added i didnt even know that was a thing so i wasnt worried about it at all
it just doesnt bother me
my daughter had the flu last week id be more worried about them catching the flu from us than us getting the coronavirus from them
it just doesnt bother me said clark
if you want to learn more about the chinese culture you can attend their open house on friday from 1 to 3 pm at the sino us friendship center in muscatine
theyll demonstrate a chinese tea ceremony how to do chinese opera makeup and taking a closer look at their costumes
fake news on social media creates panic regarding coronavirus by friday jan 31 2020 photo file
islamabad as the death toll from the deadly coronavirus continue to rise the fake news on social media regarding the issue is creating panic among the masses reported the news 
the post claims that the information was shared by the countrys health department but no such advice could be found on the its website or any official press releases related to the outbreak
the advice was shared by a facebook page called forchange
the post also had a video of a parasite being removed from a persons lips implying that the procedure was somehow related to the coronavirus
however factcheckers have clarified that the video was three months old and has no link with the virus
facebook has since marked the forchange post as false information but dozens of identical messages are still being circulated on the platform
it has also said that currently there are no vaccine against the virus but standard recommendations to prevent the infections should be adopted
also read russia to shut border with china over coronavirus
these include regular hand washing covering mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing or failing that with the crook of your arm thoroughly cooking meat and eggs avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing or fever
since its an outbreak people have been speculating the origins of the disease
the speculations took a tall when a slew of videos alleged that the consumption of bats was the reason behind the deadly outbreak in wuhan
one such clip shows a smiling chinese woman holding a cooked bat on camera before admitting it tastes like chicken meat
the video prompted outrage online with some users blaming chinese eating habits for the outbreak
however the video was not even shot in china
it was also fouryearsold and showed popular blogger and travel show host mengyun wang during a trip to palau an archipelago in the western pacific ocean
the clip resurfaced on social media after cases of the new coronavirus emerged in wuhan late last year
following the online backlash wang apologised saying she was just trying to introduce the life of local people to the audience and had not known that bats could be a virus carrier
her video has since been taken down
after the us reported its first case of the coronavirus last week several patented documents started to circulate on twitter and facebook which claimed that health experts were aware of the virus existence
one of the first users to float these allegations was a conspiracy theorist and youtuber jordan sather
the thread has been retweeted a thousand times since
sather used the fact that the bill & melinda gates foundation was a donor to both pirbright and vaccine development and alleged that the current outbreak was deliberately manufactured to attract funding for the vaccine
and how much funding has the gates foundation given to vaccine programs throughout the years?
was the release of this disease planned?
is the media being used to incite fear around it?
sather tweeted
however pirbrights patent was not for the new coronavirus
the news reported that the patent covers the avian infectious bronchitis virus a member of the wider coronavirus family that infects poultry
as for the speculation regarding the bill & melinda gates foundation pirbright spokeswoman teresa maughan told buzzfeed news that the institutes particular work with the infectious bronchitis virus was not funded by the foundation
biological weapon
another baseless statement that has gone viral claimed that the virus was part of chinas covert biological weapons programme and was leaked from the wuhan institute of virology
however the articles cited no evidence to back the claim
the israeli source also said that so far there isnt evidence or indication to suggest there was a leak
the daily star also published a similar piece last week in which it alleged that the virus might have started in a secret lab
however the piece was amended and clarified that there was no evidence for the claim
another claim inaccurately linked the virus to the suspension of a researcher at canadas national microbiology laboratory
virologist dr xiangguo qiu her husband and some of her students from china were removed from the lab following a possible policy breach according to a report by canadas national broadcaster cbc last year
police told cbc news there was no threat to public safety
a tweet with more than 12000 retweets and 13000 likes  claimed without evidence that dr qiu and her husband were a spy team had sent pathogens to the wuhan facility and that her husband specialised in coronavirus research
none of the three claims in the tweet can be found in the two cbc reports and the terms coronavirus and spy do not appear even once in either
cbc has since reported that these claims are baseless
the most popular version was uploaded to youtube by a korean user and included english and korean subtitles  the video has since been taken down
according to the english subtitles the woman is a nurse in a wuhan hospital
however she does not claim to be either a nurse or a doctor in the video at all
this seems to be merely an assumption on the part of those who have uploaded various versions of the video to social media
however her suit and mask do not match the ones worn by medical staff in hubei
due to a lockdown being enforced by the authorities it is difficult to verify videos from the province
but she makes a number of unsubstantiated claims about the virus making it unlikely for her to be a nurse or a paramedic
she also claims the virus has a second mutation which can infect up to 14 people
but the world health organisation has preliminarily estimated the number of infections an individual carrying the virus can cause is 14 to 25
she doesnt sound like someone from [a] medical professional background muyi xiao a wuhan native and the visuals editor for the chinafile online magazine told the bbc 
i think there is [a] possibility that she thinks she is telling the truth
because no one knows the truth badiucao a chinese political activist currently based in australia told the bbc 
no transparency [has] just left people guessing and panicking

coal trader noble resources research head rodrigo echeverri says the impact has been severely disruptive
so far more than 7 700 people have been infected by the virus which has resulted in more than 170 deaths
millions of people have been placed under quarantine and are unable to travel
its very disruptive in the places where supply chains and commodities are located
echeverri told delegates at the fifteenth annual southern african coal conference this week
he said this had impacted heavily on steel mills in coastal china as well as on manufacturers many of which had been forced to slow down
many employees have also been unable to get back to their workplaces in these highly industrialised areas
the bad news is that the first quarter of 2020 is going to be pretty bad in terms of business activity in china said echeverri

patients who came down with disease at the end of december all had connections to the hunan seafood market in wuhan china
the complex of stalls selling live fish meat and wild animals is known in the region as a wet market
i visited the tai po wet market in hong kong and its quite obvious why the term wet is used
theres lots of water blood fish scales and chicken guts
things are wet
at the tai po market a woman who runs a shellfish stall  she only wants to give her name as mrs wong  says people blame wet markets for spreading disease
but she says thats not fair
like just about everyone else in the market
shes heard about the links between the wet market in wuhan china and the coronavirus but doesnt think something like that would happen in hong kong
its so different from whats happening in mainland china she says
when i go to mainland china and im trying to eat something im concerned about whats in the food
meanwhile this kind of market is not just an asian phenomenon
but researchers of zoonotic diseases  diseases that jump from animals to humans  pinpoint the wet markets in mainland china as particularly problematic for several reasons
first these markets often have many different kinds of animals  some wild some domesticated but not necessarily native to that part of asia
the stress of captivity in these chaotic markets weakens the animals immune systems and creates an environment where viruses from different species can mingle swap bits of their genetic code and spread from one species to another according to biologist kevin olival  vice president for research at the ecohealth alliance
theyre known to sell animals such as himalayan palm civets raccoon dogs wild boars and cobras
the only live birds in tai po are chickens which are kept behind the butchered pork section of the market
chan shu chung has been selling chicken here for more than 10 years
he says business is really good right now because the price of pork  his main competition  is through the roof
customers say that buying chickens that are slaughtered on the spot makes them feel that theyre getting meat from fresh healthy birds
jason beaubien / npr
so people are buying more chicken
customers can select a live bird from chungs cages
chung pulls them out by their feet holds them upside down to show off their plump breasts
if the customer is happy with the bird chung puts a plastic tag with a number on the chickens foot
fifteen minutes later the shopper can come back and pick up the chicken meat
chung says he and his colleagues do their best to keep the area clean
they wash down the stalls regularly and disinfect the countertops to stop germs from spreading
chung however is one of the few people in the market who is not wearing a face mask
chung says he isnt afraid of this new coronavirus
so maybe hes on to something

any already approved faculty or staff trips will be evaluated on casebycase basis
mu spokesman christian basi said no one from the university  including faculty staff or students  are now in china
the only universitysponsored visit to china this semester a visit to shanghai as part of the semester at sea program was canceled he said
the group will instead extend the time it spends in ho chi minh city in vietnam
the outbreak began in the chinese city of wuhan and has sickened nearly 7800 people and killed more than 170 most in china the associated press reported
the world health organization on thursday declared the virus a global emergency noting that cases have been reported in 18 other countries and the first case of a person in the united states infected by someone who brought the virus back from china was reported in chicago
the infected person is the husband of a chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from the epicenter of an outbreak in china
it was the sixth us case of the virus a close cousin to the sars and mers viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past
the main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in china but because of what is happening in other countries he said
numerous airlines have canceled flights to china and businesses including starbucks and mcdonalds have temporarily closed hundreds of outlets
whether the mu travel ban will have any impact on faculty is uncertain basi said because theres no central repository for faculty trips
faculty who wish to go despite the ban will not be reimbursed for their expenses basi said
there have been no reported cases of the virus at mu or in missouri the message reads
symptoms of the coronavirus include fever cough and difficulty breathing

doctors trying to determine how the coronavirus is spreading say its not as infectious as measles but it can be passed on in several ways
researchers are looking to other coronavirus outbreaks such as sars and mers to determine how this new outbreak is spreading
australias deputy chief medical officer professor paul kelly says coronavirus is spread by close contact over a period of time and its virtually totally safe to walk past someone in the street who may be infected
its spread by a droplet in a cough or a sneeze similar to how influenza is passed on
infectious diseases physician sanjaya senanayake says droplets settle about one metre away unlike airborne viruses which are more worrying because they can travel further distances
droplet spread also means the particles dont stay in the air for long making infection less likely unless close contact occurs for a long period of time
if youre walking past someone on the street its a fairly low risk associate professor senanayake told aap
coronavirus may not be the easiest infection to get but it can be transmitted in several ways
it could for example potentially spread if a person with coronavirus stands on a street corner coughing for a while and then leaves before someone else walks past
it could also be spread via contaminated surfaces if someone touches their nose or mouth after touching a surface that has been coughed or sneezed on by an infected person
surgical masks can help stop the spread of coronavirus but they have to be fitted properly and cant be worn for too long
if we start to get lots of cases of local transmission then things are different he said
prof kelly says coronavirus does seem to spread more easily than sars and mers but isnt as infectious as measles which can be transmitted to another 12 to 18 unvaccinated people by one infected person
for the droplet infection it tends to be between one and two extra people which is still a concern prof kelly told reporters on thursday

the death toll in chinas novel corona virus outbreak reached 21  by merrit kennedy  7 hours ago passengers in a subway station in hong kong on wednesday wear masks amid the coronavirus outbreak
over the past few weeks we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response who directorgeneral tedros adhanom ghebreyesus told reporters in geneva
however tedros was adamant that the main reason for the declaration is not because of what is happening in china but because of what is happening in other countries
 let me be clear  this vote is not a declaration of no confidence in china
he said that the who is deeply concerned about what will happen if the virus begins spreading in countries with weak health systems and that the purpose of the declaration is to help those countries
the declaration of a global health emergency can work to galvanize international funding
according to the whos procedures  the three criteria for such a declaration are that it is an extraordinary event that it constitute[s] a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and that it potentially require[s] a coordinated international response
the last time the who announced an international health emergency was in july 2019 over the ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of congo
before that international emergencies were declared in 2016 for the zika virus and in 2014 for the ebola outbreak in west africa
do not travel to china due to novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan china the advisory reads
the new coronavirus has sickened around 9800 people worldwide and killed at least 213  all of them in china
the who said in a statement that all countries should be prepared for containment including active surveillance early detection isolation and case management contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of the virus
there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade
who doesnt recommend limiting trade and movement tedros added
the coronavirus drew worldwide attention after chinese authorities began reporting cases of pneumonia in the city of wuhan last month
they were able to pinpoint the cause to a previously unknown strain
health authorities believe this particular strain known as 2019ncov likely first spread from an animal
we know that this virus can cause severe disease and that it can kill although for most people it causes milder symptoms tedros told reporters last week
first the who said there is evidence that the virus could spread from human to human
this is worrying because it is easier for a virus to spread quickly between humans compared with a virus transmitted from an animal to humans
second experts still dont know for certain what animal the virus originated from in wuhan
until we know what the animal is there potentially could still be animals being sold in markets all across china that is spilling virus over into people matthew frieman a virologist with the university of maryland school of medicine recently told nprs nurith aizenman 
and third chinese authorities say the virus has also infected medical workers  people who already would be taking serious precautions to protect themselves
there is currently no targeted drug to treat the virus chinese health authorities said
several countries including the us have started to evacuate citizens from wuhan because of concerns about the coronavirus
as nprs bill chappell reported  american passengers broke into cheers after their flight from wuhan touched down tuesday night in alaska
major airlines such as united airlines and british airways have suspended flights to chinese cities
chinese health authorities recently announced new sweeping measures to try to contain the new coronavirus by implementing a strict quarantine on wuhan a city of some 11 million people
theres no sense of when the quarantine might be lifted nprs emily feng reported from beijing
the big problem is that people are going to have to return to work soon when the lunar new year is over
many of them are coming from villages where there are very few screening measures for the virus
chinas government has come under criticism for not responding more quickly to the outbreak
but who officials have praised the chinese response
in many ways china is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response

investment bank ubs on friday published a report exploring the implications of the virus  which has killed 213 people  that estimated a twomonth halt on china package tours could cost australia at least $1 billion in services exports
in 2003 the report outlined shortterm arrivals from china constituted just seven per cent of australias total inbound tourism  but this number has since ballooned to roughly 30 per cent
adding to the potential pain ubs pointed out that february and march were two of the busiest months for chinese travellers to australia making up about one quarter of annual arrivals
the ubs report also said major shopping centre operators like vicinity centres and scentre group could suffer from lower numbers of chinese tourist shoppers
but if there are bankruptcies of shops during the slow time then it will impact retail occupancy rates

new delhi  indian electronics makers are unlikely to face immediate production disruptions because of the coronavirus outbreak in china the global manufacturing base for electronic parts as many of them had stocked up in advance anticipating chinese new year holidays
many of them may have to resort to production cutbacks if the health crisis worsens in china where entire cities have been under lockdown due to the disease outbreak according to industry executives
the fact that the coronavirus outbreak happened during the chinese new year holiday period helped companies as they had to plan in advance for this quarter
rai said companies would have stocked up in advance for the january to march segment
essentially a prolonged disruption will see production capacities going down but little change in demand for electronic products in india
that said rai added that costs arent expected to increase at the moment and if they do then companies will have to pass them on to customers
he said most smartphone makers have started assembling products in india which means they already have components for this quarter
brands have components and stocks for an entire quarter in advance usually so there shouldnt be any impact in this quarter he said
if the disruptions extend for more than a month production could be seriously hurt suggested nk
the disruptions are also expected to affect global giants such as apple inc in its first quarter earnings report apple had set an unusually wide revenue guidance range of $6367 billion in view of the uncertainty
government warnings asking citizens to refrain from travelling to china have already forced companies to cut down on travel
as a result employees who had travelled to china for the chinese new year are unable to return to india while others had to cancel their plans to travel to china
further many of the chinese companies also depend on their chinese units for software r&d
this is the side of the business that takes care of smartphone user interfaces apps and other software
while some of them also have indian units for r&d as well any core issue can only be solved from china

despite recent dovish statements impressive pmi gains do highlight an economic resurgence taking place in the uk economy this month after brexit and election fears subsided

mahony added from a monetary standpoint things remain on a knife edge given the volatility of both inflation and growth likely in the months ahead
4pm ftse stabilised
londons leading index has stabilised in the afternoon session albeit well below 7400 after a busy day for corporate and macroeconomic updates
the ftse 100 was down 99 points 13% at 7385 in the us the main benchmarks are faring better than the footsie with the dow and s&p 500 down by around 06% after the release of fourthquarter us gross domestic product gdp numbers
trade stability may provide a better platform for 2020 growth but coronavirus worries could undermine it said ing economics
the unchanged fourthquarter gdp annualised growth number was slightly above the 20% increase economists had been expecting
the details show slower consumer spending growth and weak business investment being offset by another strong residential investment figure robust government spending and a plunge in imports resulting in a major contribution from net exports to the headline growth rate said james knightley ings chief international economist
meanwhile the bank of england proved it is possible to make a big splash by doing nothing  in this case leaving its base rate unchanged  although the downward revision of its uk growth forecasts also had economists pondering
no mpc [monetary policy committee] member felt compelled to join michael saunders and jonathan haskel for an immediate interest rate cut
despite some recent dovish comments earlier in january by mpc members silvana tenreyro gertjan vlieghe and mark carney indicating that they could favour a nearterm interest rate cut if the economy failed to quickly show improvement after the election they clearly decided that there had been enough evidence of this to sit tight for now at least speculated howard archer the chief economic advisor to the ey item club
the bank considered it was too early to judge the impact of the coronavirus
the bank of england also noted possible support to uk growth from the budget he added

londons index of heavyweight shares is now nursing a tripledigit fall down 102 points 14% at 7381
sterling set off higher on basis that no additional members called for a cut this time round 72 in favour of hold despite comments from the likes of vlieghe tenreyro and carney himself suggesting that further accommodation in the short term may be warranted; however the fact that very little has actually changed i feel its the correct decision for the committee to sit on their hands for now outlooks remain subdued but with early signs that growth is picking up it makes sense to await further data suggested john goldie the foreign exchange strategist at argentex group plc  lonagfx 
rupert thompson the chief investment officer at kingswood reckons the socalled boris bounce staved off a base rate cut that was looking increasingly more likely
if as is likely the bounce in the soft sentiment data is sustained and over coming months feeds through to some improvement in the hard economic data rates will very likely remain on hold
the pound gains after the bank of england keeps interest rates on hold in governor mark carneys final meeting https//tco/u5ichommdh pictwittercom/lbmvklt3nx  bloomberg @business january 30 2020 1205pm bank leaves its key lending rate unchanged
the ftse 100 dipped further into the red after the bank of england left its base rate unchanged
londons index of bluechip shares fell below 7400 to 7395 down 88 points; it was loitering around 7405 before the bank announced its rate decision
we have kept interest rates at 075%
it now expects gross domestic product gdp will rise by 08% this year having previously looked for growth of 12%
gdp is tipped to rise 14% in 2021 compared to the central banks previous forecast of 18% while the 2022 forecast has been trimmed to 17% from 20%
1150am not long now until the bank of england coin toss
the decision on whether the bank of england will cut its key interest rate today is too close to call according to daiwa capital markets
the prior two mpc meetings saw two external members  haskel and saunders  vote for a 25bp [quarter point] rate cut and since the start of the year three further members  vlieghe tenreyro and carney himself  suggested that they would be ready to vote for a rate cut if the economic recovery anticipated in the boes november base case forecast was unlikely to materialise
so certainly there is a potential majority in favour of a rate cut today and the economic case for a rate cut looks strong too daiwa said
on balance we expect the majority of members to keep bank rate at 075% for a little longer yet while also raising further the possibility of a nearterm rate cut if and when the economic data fail to improve sufficiently over the near term; however we would certainly not be surprised if the mpc voted for a 25bp rate cut today for risk management reasons and we maintain our forecast that bank rate will be cut to 05% by may at the latest daiwa added giving a masterclass in hedging its bets
im still in the cut camp admitted neil wilson of marketscom
harder data has turned notably softer and the boe doesnt want to risk allowing weakness to become entrenched
whilst pmi and cbi survey data did evince something of a boris bounce there should be sufficient doubts about whether this will be maintained to warrant a preemotive cut wilson said

1055am uk economic sentiment improves
the european commissions economic sentiment indicator esi for the uk rose to 915 in january from 882 in december
the economic sentiment indicator is moving in the right direction albeit a bit more slowly than other survey indicators opined samuel tombs the chief uk economist at pantheon macroeconomics
the headline number is a tad disappointing; the esi merely rose to a fivemonth high in january and remains well below its longrun average but the manufacturing component of the esi has a ludicrously high 40% weight even though the sector accounts for just 10% of uk gdp grumbled tombs
the election result clearly has not boosted consumer sentiment as much as business confidence though the former had less scope to rebound tombs suggested
the ftse 100 was down 55 points 07% at 7428
in the circumstances a 34 point 05% fall to 7450 for the ftse 100 is not a bad result thanks to positive responses to trading updates from evraz plc  lonevr  and unilever plc  lonulvr  offsetting loud raspberries for the updates from bt and shell

investment bank ubs on friday published a report exploring the implications of the virus  which has killed 213 people  that estimated a twomonth halt on china package tours could cost australia at least $1 billion in services exports
in 2003 the report outlined shortterm arrivals from china constituted just seven per cent of australias total inbound tourism  but this number has since ballooned to roughly 30 per cent
adding to the potential pain ubs pointed out that february and march were two of the busiest months for chinese travellers to australia making up about one quarter of annual arrivals
the ubs report also said major shopping centre operators like vicinity centres and scentre group could suffer from lower numbers of chinese tourist shoppers
but if there are bankruptcies of shops during the slow time then it will impact retail occupancy rates

hospitalisation of people suspected of coronavirus infection has brought out systemic issues in airport screening and quarantine facilities in mumbai
a 36yearold man who was admitted to the quarantine ward in mumbais kasturba hospital has claimed there were neither inflight announcements nor enquiries at the chhatrapati shivaji maharaj international csmi airport for passengers including those returning from china to report cases of cough cold or fever

the patient who was on a business tour with three others to guangzhou and shushan in china for six days told the indian express  i had a cold before the trip
in china i developed a fever once
there we didnt realise the scale of the coronavirus outbreak

at the airport too he claimed no official informed him to report if he had any symptoms for the virus
i still had a cold when i landed but i easily passed through immigration and went home
the next day i realised the extent of the outbreak
he and his colleague a 31yearold woman were admitted to kasturba hospital on january 23 while their two other colleagues were quarantined in delhi
while the 36yearold man claimed he had not come across a thermal scanner a csmi spokesperson said two such scanners have been positioned in aerobridges for air china and rwandair flights
we direct these flights to those aerobridges
the scanner can detect high body temperature from a distance of three metres the spokesperson said
a thermal scanner is a handheld device
at the mumbai airport it is mounted atop a tripod and can only detect fever but not cough and cold
that is why we encourage selfreporting by people the official said adding that more passengers in flights from hong kong may soon be screened

most passengers have themselves reported to authorities a day or more after exiting the airport

the hospitals isolation unit maintains no separate air conditioning and only has windows for ventilation
there remains no negative pressure in the ward to prevent crossinfection
it used to be cleaned 45 times a day the staffers wore masks but that is it he added

by aaron gettinger staff writer
as the world health organization declares a global health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak the university of chicago medical center ucmc has established a protocol should the hospital need to treat infected patients
unlike during the ebola virus epidemic in 2014  however the ucmc is not one of chicagos designated facilities to deal with infections should they arise locally
on thursday ucmc infection control program director rachel marrs clarified that every hospital is individually capable of screening for infections
the ucmc is operating under criteria set by centers for disease control and prevention which encompass clinical features such as fever coughing or difficulty breathing alongside epidemiological risks such travel to the diseases epicenter wuhan china
should patients meet those criteria the ucmc would seek cdc approval to test for coronavirus and send blood and respiratory samples to cdc headquarters in atlanta for confirmation
the ucmc has no designated preemptive unit for coronavirus cases
we are prepared if we have a patient that we could treat them here marrs said though she said any hospital could care for infected patients
marrs observed that the cdc currently thinks the novel coronavirus is more contagious than sars or mers which belong to the same family of viruses but is less deadly
nevertheless marrs said the new virus is still evolving and said she could not predict what the cdc would find as far as its infectability and mortality
the united states reported its first persontoperson transmission of the coronavirus on jan 30 as a woman who contracted the infection in wuhan infected her spouse in chicago
chicago public health commissioner allison arwady said there is no local emergency at this time and told residents that they do not need to cancel events avoid mass gatherings or don masks or gloves in public
currently theres not widespread activity marrs said adding that much depends on the result of the who emergency and whether more flights are canceled to and from china
if you have respiratory symptoms due to any sort of virus youd want to wear a mask
but you dont need to wear a mask for coronavirus

the doh on thursday said the patient arrived in the country from wuhan china via hongkong last jan 21

most economists pushed back their prediction to april from february just last week after betterthanexpected employment data for december
as many as 23 of 32 or nearly 72% forecast rates at 05% before june with three predicting deeper cuts to 025%
a median of 29 respondents expects the cash rate will remain at 05% through end2020 and then ease to 025% by early next year

australias a$195 trillion $133 trillion economy is in its 29th year of recessionfree expansion the longest boom among developed countries
we expect that the rba will lower its 2020 growth forecast westpac chief economist bill evans said in a note predicting two cuts this year  april and august
inflation ticked higher in the final quarter of 2019 data showed this week though core measures remained subdued despite three interest rate cuts last year
the rba expects the economy to start generating inflationary pressures only when unemployment falls to 45% or below
that could prove challenging given the jobless rate is now at 51% from as low as 49% in february
but rbas rate cuts have so far done little to boost growth
consumer sentiment surveys pointed to deepening pessimism in january as households fretted about the economic impact of a prolonged and devastating bushfire season that has so far killed 33 people and destroyed thousands of homes
the rba will also provide its updated quarterly forecasts for the economy and inflation next week

apple will release a hightech tag device for tracking everyday items and new highend headphones alongside the iphone se 2 pictured in march a report has claimed
mr kuos predictions were made in a research note from investment management firm tf international securities a copy of which macrumors have reported seeing
we forecast that apples major new hardware products in [the first half of 2020] include the 47inch lcd iphone ipad pro macbook pro/air smaller wireless charging mat uwb tag and a highend bluetooth headphone he apparently wrote
each will be small circular and made for attachment to everyday items
if the item is found by a fellow iphone user they can check the tag to find its owner and send an alert via the app
rumours that apple is developing item tracking tags  as popularised by tile  first surfaced in the september of last year when macrumors released leaked screenshots of an itemtracking sub menu being developed for integration within the find my app
the tracking tag product has reportedly been given the codename b389 during its development and will potentially be sold under the ultimate name airtags
as with the iphone 11 range mr kuo believes that the airtags will support the use of socalled ultra wideband radio technology which would allow the tags to be located with a much greater degree of accuracy than would be possible using bluetooth low energy or wifi

mr kuo reportedly expects apple to release highend bluetooth enabled headphones  although he did not provide more specifics
little is known either about the rumoured small wireless charging mat  although it would follow in the wake of the highlyanticipated airpower charging mat that was cancelled last year following quality concerns
had it been realised commercially however the airpower mat would have been capable of charging an iphone apple watch and airpods case at the same time  reportedly regardless of where on the mat each device was placed
little is known about the rumoured small wireless charging mat  although it would follow in the wake of the highlyanticipated airpower charging mat pictured that was cancelled last year following quality concerns
apple is also expected to release revamped versions of their ipad pro and macbook pro and/or air products
an ipad pro with a triplelens rear camera system  such as seen in the iphone 11 released last year  and 3d sensing for augmented reality are anticipated to be unveiled as early as march

steps put in place after ebola outbreak have been scrapped with post of global health czar eliminated and cdc funding cut
us preparedness to deal with the threat of coronavirus has been hampered by the personnel and budget cuts made by the trump administration over the past three years according to health experts
there is no one in the white house tasked specifically to oversee a coordinated governmentwide response in the event of a pandemic since the post of senior director for global health security and biothreats on the national security council nsc was eliminated last may
university apologizes for saying xenophobia is common reaction to coronavirus spread read more
the office was established in 2016 after the outbreak of the ebola virus in africa demonstrated the us government was not set up to move with the speed and decisiveness necessary to react to a really lethal epidemic
the white house global health czar was supposed to coordinate international national state and local organisations public and private to confront a global epidemic backed by the direct authority of the president
after he became national security adviser john bolton eliminated the office as part of an nsc reorganisation as he did not see global health issues as a national security priority
as the first persontoperson transmission of coronavirus in the us was reported and as evidence emerges that it could be much more contagious than initially thought health and disaster planning experts argued for contingency preparations for a global outbreak
the fact that they explicitly dismantled the office in the white house that was tasked with preparing for exactly this kind of a risk is hugely concerning said konyndyk now a senior policy fellow at the center for global development
funding has also been cut drastically to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc forcing it to reduce or discontinue epidemicprevention efforts in 39 out of the 49 countries it had been helping
among the countries where cdc efforts were scaled back were haiti rwanda and the democratic republic of congo as well as china where the agency provided technical assistance
in its 2020 budget the trump administration proposed a further 10% cut in cdc funding equivalent to $750m

funding will also dry up this year for a tiered epidemic response within the us
the system was set up in the aftermath of the ebola scare and involved identifying patients infected by special pathogens in frontline hospitals and their transfer up a chain of specially equipped regional hospitals where they could be safely treated
so not only are we creating more vulnerable hospitals but were getting this message across that hospitals if you want to prepare youre kind of on your own

while it was not a huge surprise that 2019 was unable to maintain the economic and freight volume momentum seen in 2018 the outlook for 2020 is shaping up to be closer to the latter
that was the word from speakers at this weeks smc3 jumpstart 2020 conference in atlanta
dr jeffrey rosenweig associate professor of finance; director the robson program for business public policy and government at emory university said in a presentation that when looking at the united states economy annual gdp output hovered around 25% during the presidential administrations led by george w bush and barack obama which have bee followed by some accelerations at times during donald trumps time in office and were largely spurred on by tax cuts
the current forecast is that [the economy] will still grow nobody is forecasting a recession just yet he saidbut us gdp may slow down to under 2%
while retail sales and consumer confidence remain strong rosenweig said that manufacturing a sector that in some ways is viewed as a proxy for freight activity may already be falling into recession in the us and in other major global economies too
ben hartford transportation equity research for robert w baird & co explained that looking back at 2019 featured weak volume trends elevated inventories and excess supply which all came together to plague industry fundamentals
we do see evidence that this current freight cycle should bottom during 2020 he said
it is going to be a tough first half of the year
i dont think trends have bottomed yetwhen we talk about trends it is about growth trends being less bad and improving as we finish out the year
and it was also the same for ltl weightpershipment throughout the year and airfreight and ocean volumes too up against tough annual comparisons to 2018 elevated inventories impacted by weak industrial trends also played a role as well he said
we are looking at uncertainty everyday he noted
when you contract there are a lot of contradictions in the market
what is different now is the limitless amount of data we have at our fingertipsmakes things now more of a matter of perspective in that people can find anything they want to justify any outlandish statement they want to make
with freight growth rates expected to bottom in 2020 and a tough first half of the year expected and a pending bid season approaching less bad growth rates are in the forecast for the back half of 2020 with the caveat that industrial activity will play a key role in whether that plays out or not hartford reiterated
the reality is it is a long cycle a slow growth cycle
we are near alltime cycle highs for consumer confidence though
consumer confidence tends to be the last to give up the ghost immediately before a recession

persontoperson transmissions are thought to occur when an infected person coughs or sneezes similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread

investment bank ubs on friday published a report exploring the implications of the virus  which has killed 213 people  that estimated a twomonth halt on china package tours could cost australia at least $1 billion in services exports
in 2003 the report outlined shortterm arrivals from china constituted just seven per cent of australias total inbound tourism  but this number has since ballooned to roughly 30 per cent
adding to the potential pain ubs pointed out that february and march were two of the busiest months for chinese travellers to australia making up about one quarter of annual arrivals
the ubs report also said major shopping centre operators like vicinity centres and scentre group could suffer from lower numbers of chinese tourist shoppers
but if there are bankruptcies of shops during the slow time then it will impact retail occupancy rates

now ford has another chance to deny the chiefs a championship when he faces them with the san francisco 49ers
that proved especially costly when tom brady threw an interception to charvarius ward on the play
its in a compartment of all the bad plays which you have done ford said
i was on the short end of the stick
thats all i could do
dee ford gets traded to san francisco after his afc title game blunder
tony avelar/ap instead of getting back to work with the chiefs ford found a new home
kansas city dealt him to san francisco for a 2020 secondround pick after using the franchise tag on him
the chiefs replaced ford with frank clark and now the teams will square off for a championship that was so close for kansas city last year
clark called fords mistake inexcusable earlier this postseason a description ford didnt dispute
but the chiefs dont put all the blame on their former player
we came up short last year coach andy reid said
it kind of fell on dee but it wasnt dee at all
it was all of us were 4 inches short
the niners were the big beneficiaries as ford was a big piece in the teams rebuild that has transformed them from 412 to the super bowl in one season
[more sports] super bowl livs most preposterous prop bets include trump tweets andy reids wardrobe and meals  bolstering the pass rush was the top offseason priority and the additions of ford and no
2 overall draft pick nick bosa have turned a struggling unit into one of the leagues most feared
the niners finished tied for fifth in the league with 48 sacks and sixth with 27 takeaways a year after having only 37 sacks and generating a recordlow seven takeaways
when youve got a guy like dee ford who possesses the speed he does off the edge it creates so much space for the guys inside defensive coordinator robert saleh said
whenever youve got a guy outside that can create the space where you get a true oneonone where they cant get a hand on you theres no makeshift doubleteam
it just makes everybody on the defensive line better
it kind of unlocks everything
hes a major asset
thats why he was sought after after this last season
ford dealt with injuries during the regular season and finished with only 6 1/2 sacks while playing only four snaps over the final six games

san franciscos pressure rate jumps from 227% when ford isnt on the field to 342% when he is playing according to nfl nextgen stats a sign of his importance
the niners figure to move ford around on sunday and they have even used him inside against guards in the playoffs giving offenses a different look with bosa and ford lined up next to each other

just being able to change it up change up the looks against all the offensive linemen being able to move guys around is really effective
tour companies and hotels in destinations popular with chinese tourists are starting to see cancellations after the coronavirus has led to mass quarantines and 170 deaths in china
travel agencies in china have been told to halt all group tours the stateowned china daily newspaper reported citing the china association of travel services
weve had some cancellations  although i dont have a qualified number
its early days so we cant fully anticipate the impact said angela anderson director of communications
china is an important market for us so we are hopeful the situation gets under control as soon as possible
hysan lee owner and operator of aurora holiday tours in yellowknife said hes had about 200 cancellations in the last few weeks
the company books tours and hotels for chinese people travelling to the northwest territories
lee said hes offering a full refund for the cancellations which were mostly for february and march
and alberta didnt respond to requests for interviews
travel albertas chwin said he hasnt heard about any operators or hotels that are overly worried
everybody is just being proactive and has general concern obviously for the general wellbeing of people first and secondly how it might impact the business he said
were just seeing a bit of trickle here
the impact he said is nowhere near what it was in 2003 when sars a viral respiratory illness also caused by a coronavirus hit toronto
sars was centred in canada where this is not said chwin
canada is not the focus of attention
it really did hurt the industry back in the day when sars happened while this new coronavirus is centred in china
its not really a relevant comparison
even small changes in china have global effects
benjamin so is a 27yearold doctor in hong kong
he usually works in the internal medicine department of queen mary hospital located on the southern coast of the city with sweeping views of the south china sea
this left so with a question should he be quarantined given his direct contact with two confirmed cases or was he expected to return to work the next day?
hospital management so said told him that he would not need to isolate himself because he had been in protective gear when dealing with the patients
so found this decision bizarre because there was no way of ruling out any chance of contamination
returning to work as usual he thought would only put other patients and colleagues at risk
thats how so decided to check himself into a hotel room for at least two weeks paying out of his own pocket for accommodation
i would say the hospital authority has been quite slow in responding to this outbreak and they havent had clear contingency plansit shows how limited our resources are said so referring to the government body that manages the citys hospitals
more than 6500 nurses and doctors have already pledged to strike unless the government meets their demands foremost of which is the complete closure of all 14 border control points with mainland china in order to stem the coronavirus outbreak
on tuesday jan 28 hong kong chief executive carrie lam ordered a partial closure of the border  but the measure was widely panned as ineffective because only about 10% of mainland chinese visitors come through the ports of entry being shut
to many the hong kong government appears unable to make its own decisions without first deferring to beijing
when lam announced travel restrictions for mainland chinese visitors this week it was presented not as hong kong barring entry to mainlanders but as china suspending the issuance of individual tourist visas
and with the governments continued refusal to close the border with china despite polling showing overwhelming public support for the measure people are again wondering whether officials truly have the publics interests at heart
lam doubled down on her decision at another news conference today arguing that measures to close the border would  stigmatize  mainland chinese
no one is asking for the border to be closed permanently so said
what were asking for is in the interim theres a need to very firmly tighten up border controls so that we can limit the number of further imported cases
and while the government has already banned entry to hong kong for people from hubei province the outbreaks epicenter so says this is nowhere near enough as the coronavirus has already spread throughout china
https//twittercom/leungkaichihk/status/1223198938494193664 already some 90 nurses at three hospitals called in sick earlier this week to sound the alarm ahead of the strikethey were very concerned about the quality of our facilities and that they wouldnt be able to protect themselves or our patients he said of the nurses
but he also understands that calling for medical professionals to strike can be morally fraught
the continuing resistance movement  so said has galvanized support for protest actions like strikes
the incentive for health care workers to go on strike is very low theres a lot of moral baggage were carrying so said
but if this is the only way to force the government to take real policy action then this is what we have to do
he said that friends and family are also supportive of the strike because they understand this is the last resort to force the government to take action to stop the outbreak from happening
